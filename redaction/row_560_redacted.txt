**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, three staff members of the Community Action Centre (CAC), Yasmeen Sbeih, <person>, and <person>, participated in a specialized online training on open-source investigation and geo-location analysis, offered free of charge by a specialized organization. This opportunity emerged following Yasmeen’s participation in the 58th session of the UN Human Rights Council in <LOC> in <redacted>, where she engaged with this organisation during a programme-supported mission. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Before this, CAC’s research team had limited exposure to advanced open-source investigation tools and geo-spatial analysis techniques. Submissions were based primarily on qualitative data and lacked visual or spatial components. This outcome is significant because it enhances the technical capacity (capacity building outcome) of CAC’s research and advocacy team, enabling them to produce more precise, evidence-based, and visually compelling submissions. It also reflects a commitment to empowering junior and female staff, particularly Yasmeen, by investing in their professional development and integrating them into international advocacy spaces.
