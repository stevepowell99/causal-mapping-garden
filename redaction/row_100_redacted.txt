**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Since <redacted>, the defence and security forces have been providing security and protection for civilians wishing to return to and resettle in the villages of <LOC>, Taagu and <person>, thanks to the dialogue and consultation initiated by the OCADES/CCRGS between the authorities and local community leaders.
**Significance of the outcome**: Previously, the FDS of Natiaboani, who were supposed to ensure the security of the population and the communication routes between the villages and Fada, had remained entrenched in their camp. As a result, people were unable to leave the villages, and those who were already in Fada were unable to return home to stock up on supplies, having forcibly abandoned their resources (food, poultry, cattle, goats, clothing) to go to the town of Fada. Protecting the population and securing the roads were essential to enable the people of these localities to live in their communities and move around without the risk of abduction, assassination or attack by armed terrorist groups. The consultation and advocacy work carried out by OCADES/CCRGS led the region's administrative and military authorities to take the necessary security decisions.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Terrorist attacks, targeted kidnappings and threats in various localities led the people of <LOC> and <LOC> to flee their communities. Armed terrorist groups had taken control of the roads and surrounded the villages. Many people fled their communities out of fear and sought refuge, especially in the town of Fada. Given the difficulties of living in the sites hosting internally displaced persons, many people had expressed their desire to return to their villages, but were unable to do so because of the lack of protection and security on the roads and inside the villages.
