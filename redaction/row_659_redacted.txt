**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: Since 2024, monitors in the northern, north-central and <LOC> regions of Burkina Faso have improved their practices for documenting cases of human rights abuses and violations. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Most of the cases reported by monitors in 2022 and 2023 did not fully meet the required quality criteria. This prevented them from being used in the preparation of MDR reports. With the improvement in the quality of cases, MDR reports are now of a higher standard and sufficiently credible to be used in advocacy.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The cases reported in 2022 and 2023 did not meet criteria such as accuracy of information,  obtaining informed consent from sources of information, and provision of evidence.  These criteria are now met in most cases reported in 2024.
