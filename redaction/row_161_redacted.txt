The final approved draft was called “the Charter for the Completion of the December Revolution” (CCDR). <person> then created The Charter For Completion of The December Revolution Facebook page to facilitate further discussions. although this was not very successful, it again helped to keep the momentum of resistance going on. A number of CSOs also tried to unify prodemocarcy forces and one of the main platform, the Mechanism of Unifying the Forces of the Revolution (AWQID), <person> is one of the founders and supported it in many ways. <person> contributed to the provision of its vision and mission as well as nomination of individuals with high integrity and undoubted credentials. <person> also one of the main providers of financial support. <person> also supported the RCs by providing training in leadership, security and protection, documentation and provided protection gears for frontliners, namely ghadiboon (Absolutely Angry), <person> (all female frontliners), and <person> (Kings of Engagement).  <person> also contributed significantly to a parallel initiative to form an organization that unify the individuals who works on enlightenment and democracy including academics, intellectuals, writers, and opinion formers (The Forces of Democracy & Enlightenment) (Mutoqadim).

**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The African Union (AU) suspended Sudan’s membership <redacted> after the coup, while the U.S. and European Union froze hundreds of millions of dollars of development assistance they had pledged to support Sudan’s transition.
