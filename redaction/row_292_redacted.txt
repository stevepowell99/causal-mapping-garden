**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted> and <redacted>, delegations of communities affected by human rights impacts contributed to by mining companies in Colombia (César and Cerrejon) engaged in dialogues with <redacted> financial institutions and energy companies that are part of the supply chain of coal. 
**Significance of the outcome**: It was the first time that representatives of the affected communities in Colombia engaged in direct dialogue with the energy companies since a long time (and since the publication of the PAX-SOMO report of 2021 on the contributing role of energy companies to the failure to remediate the human rights abuses that the mining companies they source from were involved with). The due diligence efforts of the energy companies have been lacking and this dialogue is important in keeping the pressure on the energy companies to act. With regards to the <redacted> with financial institutions: in 2024 financial institutions participated in investor engagements with one of the mining company. The dialogue with the victims has very likely contributed to this (outcome will be reported on <redacted>).
