**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In Mali, during <redacted>, a man and a woman, both civilians, who had been abducted in <LOC> in the commune of <LOC> and in <LOC> by elements affiliated with the EIGS, regained their freedom following a long process of discreet community negotiations initiated by the monitors and conducted by the local authorities.
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to this release, negotiations for the release of people kidnapped by the EIGS rarely succeeded, especially in the municipalities concerned. Furthermore, the monitors were not tasked with conducting negotiations. It was through their documentation work that they saw the need to provide assistance to those whose cases had been documented. Also, in relation to specific objective 2, it appears that although the monitors' work was not official, it was carried out under the umbrella of the NGO ADD, which provided them with the necessary tools and procedures. This can be seen as a commitment by the organisations to promoting human rights.
