**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Since 2022, traditional <person> and <person> chiefs and community leaders from the cantons of <LOC> in the Centre-Nord region of Burkina Faso have been meeting and discussing issues of concern to their communities, resolving at least 12 community conflicts.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before 2021, the traditional <redacted> and <person> chiefs and community leaders in the cantons of <LOC> lived in a climate of mistrust, without consultation or dialogue. In this situation, several ethnic and land conflicts remained unresolved. Now, thanks to the establishment of councils of elders by the RAJS, community leaders in each <LOC> are meeting and initiating dialogue frameworks to identify and resolve various community conflicts. This effect constitutes a major change in the behaviour of leaders, which is in line with the expected objectives, in particular SO 2. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The establishment of councils of elders has enabled community leaders to meet, engage in dialogue and understand each other. Thanks to this rapprochement between leaders through councils of elders in each <LOC>, it is an endogenous mechanism for managing and preventing community conflicts in a participatory and inclusive manner. The councils are gradually integrating women into community activities, particularly through their participation in dialogues and home visits, thereby strengthening a gender-sensitive approach.
