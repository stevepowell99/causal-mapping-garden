**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Since 2023, the <person> and <redacted> communities in the <LOC> of <person> in the <LOC> region (north-central) that were once in conflict have been <redacted>, which is evidenced by a clear reduction in conflicts, when comparing figures <redacted>.  
**Significance of the outcome**: Before 2023, relations between the <person> and <redacted> communities in the <LOC> of <person> were particularly tense. The two groups lived side by side, but their coexistence was marked by mistrust, prejudice and recurring conflicts, linked in particular to access to land, the management of natural resources (water, grazing, crops) and historical tensions related to the settlement of internally displaced persons. The inclusion of others in the <LOC> celebrations raised awareness among the population about living together and peaceful coexistence. This eased the climate of mistrust between ethnic groups. This effect is a major change in the behaviour of members of ethnic groups and is fully in line with SO 2 of the SCC programme. The integration of the theme of social cohesion into <person> (the <redacted> traditional festival of the canton of <LOC>), through the intervention of the RAJS/CN and the official opening of the event to all communities, including the <person>, has created a positive change. For the first time, <person> representatives were invited to actively participate in the festival, singing, storytelling and presenting their culture on an equal footing with the Mossi. This powerful act broke down a symbolic wall of exclusion. Since then, relations between the <person> and <person> have visibly improved: community leaders communicate more regularly, young people from both groups participate in activities together, and joint initiatives have been launched in the <LOC>. This rapprochement is helping to ease tensions and lay the foundations for sustainable coexistence. This change is crucial because it reduces historical divisions, prevents violent inter-community conflicts and establishes a climate of trust through a cultural and participatory approach.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: This effect is not limited to passive coexistence: it marks a change in <redacted> attitudes and behaviour, particularly among community leaders, young people and women. The programme has helped break down symbolic barriers of exclusion and identity-based <redacted> by promoting moments of mutual recognition and cultural participation. The inclusive organisation of <LOC> served as an emotional and social catalyst, valuing diverse <redacted> and showing that every community has a place in the public sphere. This effect is all the more significant given that it concerns a historically sensitive area (<person>), where coexistence between <person> herders and Mossi farmers has been marked by cycles of tension. The two groups now interact more, reducing the risk of violent conflict. For instance, communities are increasingly <redacted> joint <redacted> such as the peace field established in 2023, which allows the <person>, <person> and internally displaced persons to cultivate a common field whose harvests are used to provide assistance to vulnerable people in the locality. This rapprochement has inspired other cantons and municipalities facing similar tensions.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Engaged citizens
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: This change is the direct result of <redacted>raising, community dialogue and inter<redacted> mediation <redacted> carried out by RAJS/CN with the support of the programme in 2023. It is also the result of the integration of social cohesion and peace themes into the <LOC> celebrations in 2023, thanks to advocacy and awareness-raising on the importance of living together within communities by the Dima of Boussouma. These actions have helped to build trust between community and religious leaders, while creating a safe and trusting environment for discussion between groups. Inclusive participation in <LOC> then served as a lever to strengthen these ties. The programme has therefore helped to transform the perceptions and behaviours of both communities by addressing the root causes of mutual mistrust.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes. Community leaders facilitated rapprochement between communities through their personal commitment to dialogue. The <person> of <person> also supported this peace process by encouraging the inclusive participation of different ethnic groups. Furthermore, the willingness of local populations to turn the page on conflict, in the face of common challenges related to internal displacement and insecurity, played a catalytic role.
