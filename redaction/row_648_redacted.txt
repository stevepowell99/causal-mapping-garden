**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, the Directorate-General for Human Rights took note of the human rights concerns of internally displaced persons (IDPs) in <LOC> and made recommendations to the state actors responsible for protecting their human rights.
**Significance of the outcome**: Given the difficult context in the country, CSOs were no longer able to carry out human rights monitoring work in the field. Collaboration with the Human Rights Directorate encouraged the government to document cases of human rights violations and abuses against vulnerable populations, namely internally displaced persons (IDPs), to produce a report, to accompany them and to offer them avenues for redress.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The collaboration made it possible to listen to more than 300 IDPs in camps or gatherings of internally displaced persons to ensure that their human rights were respected. The action also involved listening to and supporting internally displaced women and children in order to identify cases of GBV and provide support to victims.

**Contribution of the programme**: PAX has engaged in constructive dialogue with the authorities on the human rights situation in the context of the security crisis, which mainly affects internally displaced persons. These exchanges led to a request from the Directorate General for Human Rights for financial support from PAX to carry out field monitoring in order to document cases and produce recommendations, while providing accompaniment and support to victims. PAX funded a series of holistic activities, the implementation methodology for which was agreed upon. These activities included listening sessions with victims and communities in <LOC>; awareness-raising sessions on human rights and avenues of redress; support and guidance sessions for identified victims; and training for actors on the right to reparation and case follow-up.
