**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, a family from the village of <LOC> in <LOC> belonging to the <redacted> minority group contacted the Peace and Freedom Organization and reported their desire to apply for compensation for their daughter, who is a  survivor of ISIS. Her case was referred to C4JR (a coalition of civil society organizations on justice and reparations in Iraq) who then assigned a lawyer to follow up on her case.
**Significance of the outcome**: Most members of the <redacted> minority group do not recognize the existence of female survivors within their community due to customs and traditions. Following their engagement in the project's DwtP activities in the area and upon learning about the existence of a law that enables financial and non-material compensation for survivors, victims of HR abuses in the village contacted PFO and asked them to increase their awareness-raising efforts in the area, resulting in the shabak female survivor pursuing her transitional justice rights. Therefore, engaging victims of this minority group in DwtP activities proved effective in influencing the rigid norms within this specific community, setting a precedent for other female survivors of minority groups to seek reparations.  
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The Coalition for Fair Compensation is a coalition of civil society organizations that works to strengthen the enforcement of the Survivors Law. The coalition has previously voiced its inability to reach shabak female survivors in <LOC> villages due to the community's traditional aspect.
