**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Kenya
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In 2024 in Kenya, 13 HRDs were for the first time profiled in a comic book and their visibility enhanced as a protection mechanism against judicial  persecution by the <redacted> government. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The #Persecuted4SpeakingUp comic book campaign, executed by the Defenders Coalition, aimed to highlight the persistent and growing threats faced by Human Rights Defenders (HRDs) in Kenya. HRDs, particularly those working in sensitive areas such as freedom of expression, whistleblowing, and activism, often find themselves targeted for harassment , intimidation, violence, and even legal persecution. This campaign sought to raise awareness of their plight through an innovative medium—comics. In <redacted>, the civic space in Kenya has continued to shrink, with HRDs, journalists, and activists frequently finding themselves on the receiving end of state suppression. This crackdown has been carried out through physical attacks, arbitrary arrests, and smear campaigns. The #Persecuted4SpeakingUp comic book campaign used stories that mimic reality to bring these challenges to life, offering readers a powerful narrative of courage, resilience, and the ongoing fight for justice.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The idea behind the campaign stemmed from the need to engage a broader audience, especially young people, in conversations around civic freedoms, human rights, and the protection of those who risk their lives to uphold these values. Traditional forms of advocacy, while effective, often fail to reach and resonate with younger, digitally-savvy audiences. The comic book format was ideal for its ability to capture complex issues in a visually compelling and relatable way, making the struggles of HRDs more tangible and emotionally impactful. The 13 HRDs were from several counties
