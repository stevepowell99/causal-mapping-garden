**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, the Register of Damage Caused by the Aggression of <LOC> against Ukraine was established in the <LOC> and listed environmental damage as one of the categories for the collection and recording of claims, with the purpose to get compensations from the aggressor state. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The Register of Damage for Ukraine is a very important initiative to ensure justice and accountability for the damage caused by <redacted> aggression, which can set a global accountability precedent. Having environmental damages part of this new mechanism can be ground-breaking for the prospects of claiming compensations not only by Ukraine, but potentially, by other conflict-affected states in the future. The process around the Register of Damage may also contribute to the establishment of methodology and guidelines for assessing economic cocts of environmental damage, which currently constitutes a gap. Altogether, this development is crucial for EPS programme objective of ensuring accountability for conflict-linked environmental destruction.
