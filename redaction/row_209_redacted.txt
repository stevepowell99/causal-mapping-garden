**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Following the <redacted> of the prison situation of detainees in the High Security Prison and the advocacy work <redacted> by civil society actors, the <redacted> of Burkina Faso and the prison security guards in <redacted> have committed <redacted> to improving respect for human rights in the prison environment and to punishing abuses and <redacted> by revising the rules governing the <redacted> of prison security guard personnel on <redacted>. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The purpose of revising the regulations governing the <redacted> of prison security guard staff is to correct the shortcomings noted in Decree No. <redacted>/PRES/PM/MJPDH/MFPTSS/MEF governing the discipline of prison security guard staff, and to make the offences and related penalties more explicit in order to promote greater respect for human rights in <LOC> prisons.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Improving respect for human rights in prisons requires the involvement of all the key players, in <redacted> the prison security guards, in order to bring about changes in their attitudes towards detainees, as the humanisation of prisons and respect for the human rights of detainees also depend on the accountability of GSP staff. A review of the decree had already been started by the prison administration, but the process had stalled due to political instability (coup d'état in <redacted>) and a lack of financial resources to finalise the process. This revision was no longer a priority for the government authorities at the time.
