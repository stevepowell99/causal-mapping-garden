**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Kenya
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: The international community closely monitored the situation of civic space and human rights defenders in the run up to the elections in Kenya because of the <redacted> information shared by 2 staff members of Defenders Coalition Kenya during private engagements with representatives of the <redacted> missions (Germany, Sweden, European Union, United Kingdom), UN Special <redacted> and the Civic Space Unit of the United Nations Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights in <LOC> during the 50th session of the Human Rights Council in <LOC> (<redacted>), as evidenced by the press release issued by UN Special Procedure experts. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Following <redacted> of HR <redacted> and the general operating environment for HRDs from 2021, Defenders Coalition had collated critical information/trends analysis in the lead up to the elections including on excessive use of force by police, reemergence of gangs, business and human rights conflicts; and for which it ought to mobilize the focus of the international community on Kenya. For instance, during the election period, WHRDs were targeted (e.g. through majorly violations in the form of sexual abuse) especially in areas where other leaders (especially male) felt that women were not ready to lead.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: During the 50th session, the Defenders Coalition shared updates on the upcoming mid-term periodic review (<redacted>). <redacted> UN and other actors (e.g. representatives of <redacted> missions) were informed on the <redacted> of WHRD participation in the process. For the 2022 elections, women aspirants in Kenya were being denied opportunities to vie for elective seats. Defenders Coalition thus advocated for measures to be put in place that would ensure equity (a better position/role for women within electoral processes) during electoral processes in Kenya – in 2022 and beyond. The two representatives of Defenders Coalition also attended the high level meeting with Special Procedures. They updated the Special Rapporteur on Human Rights on the situation of HRDs in Kenya. The Special Rapporteur for Human Rights Defenders committed to make a visit to Kenya to assess the situation of human rights defenders in Kenya, but has not yet been able to do so as he has not yet received an official invite from the <redacted> government.
