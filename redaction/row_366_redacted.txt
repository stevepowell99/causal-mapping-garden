**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On <redacted> and <redacted> the <redacted> intelligence service (SNR) confirmed the whereabouts of three missing persons, much to the relief of their families and the public.
**Significance of the outcome**: People are often abducted by agents of the intelligence services or other people in power. Sometimes they are abducted from their homes or public places, as in the case of Janvier Ngendakuriyo and Pacifique Mahoro. Sometimes it is detainees who are exfiltrated from prison, often in the dead of night, to secret destinations, as in the case of Corporal Jean Ndikuriyo. In some cases, these individuals have never resurfaced, having been executed. In other cases, these prisoners are taken to the national intelligence service to be tortured or forced to sign documents under duress. So each reappearance in public prisons is a relief for the family and a victory for those campaigning against enforced disappearances.
