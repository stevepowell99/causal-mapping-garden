**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Niger
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Since 2025, in Niger, ROTAB started to systematically take action to make its activities and office accessible and inclusive for people with disabilities
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to 2025, ROTAB did not have specific, up-to-date institutional policies on inclusion and accessibility for people with disabilities, which limited the systematic consideration of inclusion/gender perspectives in their actions. The development of these policies is an important change as it formalises the inclusion approach, strengthens the quality of interventions and enables a better response to the specific challenges faced by women and men, including those with disabilities, in the intervention areas.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: This initiative is particularly relevant in the <redacted> context, where inequalities are high and women and people with disabilities are often the first victims of security and humanitarian crises. These policies will serve as a framework for the development of inclusion-sensitive programmes and targeted advocacy actions.
