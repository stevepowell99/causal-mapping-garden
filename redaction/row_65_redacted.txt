**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On <redacted>, during the launch of <redacted> of Activism campaign "No Shame No Blame" on social media, two TV anchors were targeted online for supporting the campaign by sharing survivor stories on Twitter. The attack was carried out by a media outlet, which is known for spreading fake news claiming that the stories the anchors were sharing were their own personal stories. As a results, one anchor issued a clarification in a subsequent tweet and deleted the first tweet where she shared a survivor story. The other anchor, however, chose not to delete her original tweet and instead urged her followers to read the message thoroughly before passing any judgment. It should be noted that sharing stories and testimonies of survivors of sexual assault was an integral part of the campaign's activities to normalize the sharing of stories and raise awareness of the <redacted> threat of sexual violence women experience, including by sharing tweets of others' experiences. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The main objectives of the campaign was to raise awareness about laws and crimes of sexual assault and demand increased sentences for crimes of sexual assault listed in Chapter 1 of title 7 of the Lebanese Penal code. The attack on the two TV anchors reflects the unethical and patriarchal mentalities that seek to discredit and undermine efforts to combat sexual assault and support survivors. This outcome serves as a reminder of the importance of creating safe spaces for survivors to share their stories and experiences without being blamed and judged on social media platforms.

**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Media
**Scale**: Individual
**Contribution of the programme**: The campaign directly challenged sensitive taboo issues by directly quoting surviors' sexual assault stories and experiences on social media platforms,  especially in <LOC> countries. We intended to work with influencers who have wide outreach in order to reach the highest number of people. By attacking the TV anchors, it was clear how right-wing "fake news" media outlets view tackling taboo issues as a threat to their world view, and how they use strategies such as victimizing campaign supporters to undermine the campaign. This indirect outcome arose as a product of the resistance toward the addressing and combatting sexual assault and harassment. This outcome also shed light on the importance of continuing on with these advocacy  campaigns and strategies aiming at decreasing/ending the sexual assaut and crimes in the lebanon and other countries facing the same issues and how others can benefit from these movements.
