**Significance of the outcome**: The outcome was significant in the sense that it was the first time that a representative of the victims engaged in direct dialogue with the company (now) (co-)responsible for remediating the adverse impacts in <LOC>, expressing the grievances and directly voicing the ask of the victims towards this company.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The dialogue was part of a mediation process offered by the Norwegian National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines, after PAX, together with 7 other <redacted> and <redacted> civil society organisations (including victims' organisations) filed a complaint with this NCP against Aker BP for failing its responsibilities under the OECD Guidelines and contributing to an adverse impact, namely the perpetuation of the ongoing denial of remedy to the victims.
