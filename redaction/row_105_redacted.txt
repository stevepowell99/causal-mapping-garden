**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Following the physical and digital security <redacted> training courses in <redacted> and in HEAT in <redacted> for PAX partners in Burkina Faso, there will be greater security and safety for partners and greater adherence to security and safety protocols by partners in carrying out their actions and for their own safety.
**Significance of the outcome**: Partners were increasingly at risk because of the deteriorating security environment in which they work, but also because of their limited knowledge and skills in managing physical and digital security and appropriate behaviours for working in hostile environments. Training was important to fill the knowledge gap and ensure that partners were equipped to prevent most of the risks associated with their physical and online security in the insecure environment.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Following the theoretical and practical training received, the partners adopted the practice of systematically carrying out a risk assessment before each mission. Several of the partners (AFEDEB, OCADES, RAJS) readjusted their actions and behaviour because of the change in context for their projects. The partners had not previously received any safety training and did not know how to behave in the current difficult context.
**Rating significance**: large
