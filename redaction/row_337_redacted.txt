**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: The updated OECD <redacted> for MNE, published in <redacted>, now include a reference to the expectation on companies to conduct enhanced HRDD in conflict-affected areas and to respect IHL
**Significance of the outcome**: The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct form, together with the UN Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights, the international authoritative norms on responsible business conduct. The UN Guiding Principles already included references to HRDD in conflict-affected areas and to IHL, but the OECD Guidelines (which tend to be referenced more often by corporate actors and in the context of due diligence legislation) not yet. Now they do. This gives actors that are advocating for explicit (legislative/practical) attention for the heightened risks and corresponding responsibilities for companies operating in conflict-affected settings (e.g. PAX) more leverage.
