**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, several project-funded CBOs in <person> led by <LOC> women and other young members of minority groups collaborated and launched a large initiative aimed at addressing the institutional marginalization of <redacted> villages.
**Significance of the outcome**: Since the invasion by ISIS, <person> has experienced heightened sectarian tensions, particularly between the <redacted> and <LOC> communities. These tensions have been notably acute between the <LOC> and <redacted>, with the relationship between Bashiqa town and neighboring <redacted> villages particularly affected by these tensions. At the start of the project, CBOs (typically composed of one societal component) were resistant to the project's inclusive approach and were less inclined to include members of other communities in their activities. That was especially the case with <LOC> volunteers. After taking part of trainings and coaching efforts by PFO, and following their implementation of several project initiatives, a community peace team, spearheaded by a young <LOC> woman, has dedicated its efforts to advocating for the rights of the <redacted> community. Volunteer groups and civil society activists throughout Iraq are increasingly committed to fostering a holistic approach that prioritizes human rights, women's rights, freedom of religion and belief, and the promotion of peaceful coexistence. The project is therefore taking part of this trend.
