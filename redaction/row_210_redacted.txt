**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In 2022, the Burkina Faso authorities have taken steps to facilitate access to justice for suspected terrorists held in Burkina Faso prisons by recruiting court interpreting assistants in national languages such as <redacted>-Gourmantché-Mooré-Fulfuldé and <redacted>-Dioula-Mooré-Fulfuldé.
**Significance of the outcome**: The judicial response to terrorism has resulted in  more than a thousand people detained, most of them in the High Security Prison (PHS) in <LOC>, which is now overcrowded. The lack of interpreters limits access to justice for the poor and those who do not speak French. Since <redacted>, the Ministry of the Civil Service, Labour and Social Security has been recruiting forty (40) court interpreting assistants for the following options: <redacted>-Gourmantché-Mooré-Fulfuldé and <redacted>-Dioula-Mooré-Fulfuldé. The role of these interpreting assistants is to provide language translation and interpretation during court hearings.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: One of the reasons why the PHS is overcrowded is the insufficient number of magistrates. There were only twelve (12) magistrates at the anti-terrorist centre, assisted by a single interpreter in <person> and Arabic. However, many of the detainees do not understand <redacted>, <person> or Arabic. In addition, for those who do understand <person> and Arabic, the fact that there is only one interpreter means that the magistrates have to coordinate so as not to conduct their interviews at the same time. All these factors contribute to the prolonged detention without trial of people held at the PHS, and thus violate their right of access to justice.
