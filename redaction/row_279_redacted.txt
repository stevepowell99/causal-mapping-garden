**Significance of the outcome**: This effect is significant in that it reflects the provincial authority's recognition of its responsibility to protect human rights. This is an evolution, as it was rare for the authorities to give clear written instructions to subordinates regarding human rights violations, fearing a kind of self-accusation instead of only verbal instructions during meetings which was done sometimes previously.
