**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Civil society actors have increased their visibility and are taking effective action in situations of human rights violations that are increasingly brought to their attention.
**Significance of the outcome**: As a result of the capacity building provided to monitors by local associations and the monitoring work carried out, not only has the visibility of the partners been improved, but above all the monitors are constantly approached by victims or their next of kin with a view to reporting cases of abuse and/or violations. On several occasions, the monitors have been able to secure the release of people who have been arrested and/or detained arbitrarily, thanks to better collaboration with both the judicial and administrative authorities.
