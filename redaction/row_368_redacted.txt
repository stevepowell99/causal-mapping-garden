**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, during the 9th <redacted> of States Parties to the Arms Trade Treaty (CSP9), it was decided to start a new sub-working group focused on <redacted> discussions on practical <redacted> implementation in 2024.
**Significance of the outcome**: Over <redacted>, until very recently, there was practically no space in plenary sessions to discuss specific arms transfers, often countered by claiming it would '<redacted>' the debate (often an argument to kill debate), whereas civil society <redacted> has <redacted> the <redacted> of <redacted> specific arms transfers for the treaty to be relevant. Slowly, since 2019, a shift was emerging, recognising this need (as well as recognising that it became time to talk about substance, rather than only <redacted>). So, in <redacted>, for the first time, after <redacted>, it was decided that in future plenary ATT meetings a platform will be created to start discussions on 'emerging issues', such as specifically relevant arms exports. This is about the  main purpose of the Treaty: to make sure that behaviour of <LOC> is changing to more responsible arms trade, with the aim to reduce human suffering.
