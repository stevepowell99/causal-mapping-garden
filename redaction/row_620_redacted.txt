**Significance of the outcome**: 1) Where Morningstar and MSCI used to flag companies that were active in the OPT, they have now removed <redacted> to the OPT from the risk assessments for <redacted> companies. This happened under pressure from <redacted> lobby groups in the US that had started to build up since +/-2016. 2) The majority of financial institutions make use of (and are dependent on) the data provided by large ESG dataproviders like Morningstar and MSCI in assessing human rights risks related to their investments.

If the ESG dataproviders no longer flag companies as subject to human rights risks in the OPT, it becomes more difficult to hold these companies accountable.
