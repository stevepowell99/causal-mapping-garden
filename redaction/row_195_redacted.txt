**FragmentID**: SCC-<redacted>/PHR018
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: The administrative authorities in the centre-north region are committed to <redacted> and combating land disputes by building cattle tracks, thanks to the <redacted>raising and advocacy work carried out by the RAJS and PAX in 2022.
**Significance of the outcome**: Conflicts over land are identified as one of the major causes of community conflicts between herders (mainly ethnic Peulh) and farmers (mainly ethnic <person>). Most of these land conflicts are due to the lack of demarcation lines between cattle tracks and fields. The construction of cattle tracks will help to significantly reduce community conflicts and preserve peace within the communities.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: To ensure that the cattle tracks are built, it is important that these concerns are included as priority projects in the communal development plans (PCD) of the target communes. New PCDs are currently being drawn up in the communes of <LOC> and <person>.  The advocacy work already carried out has led the local authorities to include the marking of cattle tracks as a priority in the roadmap for the <redacted> PCDs. Once the PCDs and Regional Development Plans (PRDs) have been drawn up, adopted, validated and financed, the communes involved will be able to benefit from technical and financial support to carry out the PCD and PRD actions. The inclusion of land issues on the roadmap would not have been possible without the advocacy work carried out.

During this meeting, the advocacy message was addressed to the President of the special delegation, calling for cattle tracks to be taken into account in the new CDP for the commune of <LOC>.

**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Some development NGOs in <LOC> have taken an interest in the issue of cattle tracks. Their scope of action, covering support for the construction of infrastructure, also contributed to the decisions taken by the members of the Special Delegations.
