**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Community conflicts based on ethnic stigmatisation have been reduced thanks to the involvement of political, religious and economic leaders and the messages they have sent out following the actions of the OCADES/CCRGS <redacted> <redacted> and <redacted>.
**Significance of the outcome**: With the conflicts linked to the security crisis, ethnic and religious stigmatisation has increased. Analysis of the regional context shows that there is a great deal of mistrust between ethnic and religious communities. In terms of ethnic stigmatisation, one community (the <person>) is the most stigmatised, as many citizens equate the Peuhls with terrorists. The involvement of religious and customary leaders is necessary to prevent crises and restore peace. This is why the OCADES/CCRGS consortium has worked to mobilise the religious and customary leaders of <LOC> and <LOC> to prevent and reduce cases of stigmatisation based on religion, ethnicity and social status in these localities. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: As a result of the terrorist attacks, which led to a crisis of confidence, particularly with regard to the Peulh ethnic group, all the Peulh had to flee <LOC> and Nagare to save their lives. The aim of the consultation and dialogue initiatives, including the rapprochement (reconciliation) between communities, was to restore social cohesion and understanding between ethnic groups and religions in the <LOC> region.

They also made it possible to propose <redacted>, <redacted> and accepted solutions to enable the <redacted> to return safely to their villages. Focus groups or <redacted> groups were then held from <redacted>. An ethnic forum called ‘community day’, where each community demonstrated the values of its culture to the others, was held on <redacted> in Fada. An interactive radio programme was then broadcast on <redacted> with contributions from religious and traditional leaders on peaceful cohabitation between ethnic groups.  With a view to improving collaboration between civilians and the military, the OCADES/CCRGS <redacted> organised <redacted>raising sessions on 27 and 28 October 2022 in Fada on civil-FDS collaboration in a context of <redacted>.
