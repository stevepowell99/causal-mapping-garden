**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, the Norwegian National Contact Point for the OECD <redacted> issued a <redacted> final statement on the complaint that PAX and others had filed against Aker BP in <redacted>, affirming HRDD requirements during mergers and acquisitions
**Significance of the outcome**: 1) The OECD Guidelines are the soft law standard for businesses on how to identify, address and remediate human rights impacts they are involved with throughout their value chains. Sometimes there can be gaps when it comes to how to interpret/apply the guidelines in specific situations, which can create loopholes for companies. This was the case for what companies should do when they merge with or acquire a significant part of another company that has contributed to human rights violations and that still has an unfulfilled remedy responsibility. 2) NCP statements on individual cases can act as jurisprudence as they clarify what companies in general should be doing in certain kinds of situation. These are authoritative statements that help in supporting the implementation of the OECD Guidelines. The statement on the <person> BP case explicitly affirmed that during mergers and acquisitions the involved parties need to include the wider human rights impacts of these mergers and/or acquistions in their due diligence process.
