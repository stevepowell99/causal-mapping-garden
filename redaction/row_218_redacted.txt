**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Following the training on Effective Data Management and  Report Writing 15 <person> shared reports with improved referenced and evidence based data used to inform advocacy engagements on the human rights situation in Burundi.
**Significance of the outcome**: In the L&A capacity <redacted> conducted in 2022, the local partner (CBDDH) identified 'Capacity to produce evidence (including research skills, links with knowledge institutions/think tanks; ability to commission or critique research)' as a gap area. The primary role of <redacted> CSOs in exile is to produce credible evidence of the human rights violations occurring in Burundi for advocacy and accountability. With the need for quality reports and evidence, comes an additional demand for skills in research, analysis, and writing. Many of the CSOs and WHRDs have had some limitations in these skills. Additionally, a needs assessment was conducted  to evaluate partners' understanding of reporting requirements, and to ascertain how they use the data collected.  The gaps identified included; limited clarity on results and objectives, formulation and analysis of results, understanding of a good report, and how to improve analysis and writing. With these gaps, it was important to support the partners with training  to boost their skills and confidence in effective data management and reporting. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In brief, the training focused on: a review of actual and required reporting standards, best practices for quality reporting, the data life cycle, and effective use of data for advocacy. Partners engage in monitoring and documentation of the human rights situation in Burundi to develop reports. With more ability to analyse data and write good reports, they are able to  have better evidence for advocacy engagements. The increased capacity of (W)HRDs in effective data management and report writing enhanced the quality and presentation of information jointly presented with <redacted> HRDs and CSOs at the UN/AU human rights mechanisms.
