**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, Ouédraogo <person>, a beneficiary of the peace and social cohesion talks led by heroine <person>, resolved a family dispute between two neighbours, <person> and <person>, in sector 10 of <LOC> in <LOC>/Yatenga province/Northern region of <LOC>
**Significance of the outcome**: In the northern region, family disputes between neighbours are common. These are usually small fights between children that turn into conflicts between mothers who want to defend their children. These are conflicts that are generally settled out of court through the intermediary of other people, to avoid the traditional justice system, which can undermine good relations and social cohesion. This is an important effect because it is directly in line with our change 2, which is to reduce social conflicts within communities by involving religious leaders through theatre forums, panels and workshops

She benefited from the talks on peace and cohesion given by our heroine <person><redacted>e contribution is great: the family dispute was settled out of court and was not brought before the traditional courts. If it were brought before the traditional courts, the law would certainly be upheld, but the conflict could spread to the extended families of both parties, which would not be good for social cohesion. The change is positive and intentional: the conflict has been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. The neighbours are now talking to each other and there is nothing to indicate that the conflict may reignite.
