**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: Since 2021, the human rights situation in relation to the fight against terrorism has been documented and made known thanks to the establishment of a permanent mechanism for systematic monitoring of abuses and violations committed by the defence and security forces and armed groups in the centre-north, north and <LOC> regions.
**Significance of the outcome**: In the fight against this phenomenon, the Defence and Security Forces (FDS) and their auxiliaries are regularly the subject of allegations of human rights violations, in particular summary and extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and enforced disappearances. Thanks to the technical and financial support of <LOC>, CIFDHA and MBDHP regularly document and report cases of alleged human rights violations committed by the FDS and their auxiliaries in these three regions. It is important for the situation to be made known so that corrective action can be taken to ensure that human rights are respected by all parties. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Since 2015, Burkina Faso has been affected by a security crisis linked to the expansion of terrorist groups on its territory.  The North, Centre-North and <LOC> regions are among those most affected by the security crisis. To better document cases of human rights violations and abuses committed in these regions, CIFDHA, in collaboration with MBDHP, has set up a network of human rights monitors as well as a digital mechanism to monitor and document cases of abuse, abuses and/or violations of rights committed by parties in conflict. Local people living in the affected areas, who are the first victims of terrorism and SDF abuses, know about and use the mechanism in place to report cases of which they are aware or when they are victims..

**Contribution of the programme**: <LOC> initiated 2 initial training sessions in <redacted>, documentation and reporting (MDR) from 3 to 7 and 17 to 21 August 2020 respectively for 30 human rights monitors who are members of MBDHP and CIFDHA. 18 of the most assiduous and competent monitors received advanced training in SDR from 25 to 29 November 2020. All these monitors live in the centre-north, north and <LOC> regions. A digital mechanism for reporting and documenting cases of abuse or violations has been developed thanks to funding from Amnesty and enables monitors to document the facts. Amnesty is supporting a supervisory team of 6 people to assess the quality and credibility of the cases reported by the monitors. All the cases will be processed and analysed in order to produce a report on the human rights situation in the areas concerned.
