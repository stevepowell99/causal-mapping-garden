**Significance of the outcome**: Before the intervention, the President of the Republic denied that there were enforced disappearances in Burundi (for example, in an interview dated <redacted> with RFI and France24).  On <redacted>, the President changed position a little, recognising that "<redacted> take place, [...] committed by terrorist groups". Then finally, his statement in <person> on <redacted> clearly recognised that "abductions and disappearances take place [...] committed by security forces".

Faced with this pressure, the President may have started changing his position, contributing to his statement in <person> in <redacted>. Then in <redacted>, FOCODE published a letter to the President of the Republic informing him that at least 80 people disappeared during the reign of President <person> In writing the letter, FOCODE used the knowledge acquired during the MDR training by AINL; more specifically: some language is now more specific (such as the use of "violation" vs. "abuse"), while there has gradually been more attention also to proper interviewing and the verification of specific details in the cases.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Publications by FOCODE without the support of the SCC (see previous column; AINL only started <redacted> FOCODE in 2022).
