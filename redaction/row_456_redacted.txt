**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: From <redacted>, 2024 during the conference of <LOC> (a civilian body leading national efforts to stop the war in Sudan) in <LOC> Abba, <person> head of Alharissat (PAX partner) was nominated as the head of the female branch in the <LOC>.
**Significance of the outcome**: During the <LOC> conference, the general assembly called to elections. This process marked a significant milestone in women’s political participation in Sudan. This event brought together a wide range of influential political and civil society actors, and for the first time, women who had long been engaged in grassroots organizing and advocacy were formally recognized and invited to participate in shaping political maters at the national level.   This outcome is particularly significant given the highly polarized and fragile political environment in Sudan, including tensions within the <LOC> platform itself. Historically, women have been excluded from such political spaces, and previous attempts at inclusion were often met with resistance or even violence. The peaceful and constructive nature of this conference stands out as a turning point. The nomination of Hadia reflects the achievement of unifying women around a shared vision and ensuring their voices were present in a high-level political platform like <LOC>, It shows a key advance in women’s ability to influence Sudan’s transitional political processes and long-term peacebuilding efforts.  
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Alharissat, a women-led initiative active in community peacebuilding and advocacy, brings grounded, locally informed perspectives to national politics—an approach that has often been overlooked in elite-driven dialogues.  This outcome is also notable for its innovative, bottom-up model of participation. Rather than relying solely on elite quotas or formal party structures, the process recognized informal networks and civil society leaders as legitimate political actors. This blending of grassroots legitimacy with formal political influence is a critical innovation in <redacted> political culture.  Ultimately, this development sets a precedent for inclusive governance in Sudan’s ongoing transitional process. It positions women not just as beneficiaries of peace or policy, but as active shapers of Sudan’s political future. The peaceful and constructive nature of the conference—and the recognition of women like <person>—signal a turning point toward more democratic, inclusive, and locally grounded political solutions in Sudan.
