**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, <person>, a young <redacted> man with special needs, requested and was successfully awarded a referral letter from the director of the Disability and Special Needs Department in <person> for his master's degree application. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Many people with disabilities belonging to minority groups, particularly within the <redacted> community, remain unaware of their rights, stemming from a deep-seated intergenerational mistrust in the <redacted> national legal framework. This skepticism towards <redacted> legislation and governmental practices has left many unaware of the legal provisions designed to benefit people with disabilities and special needs, especially those included in the new survivor's law. One such provision includes preferential treatment for people with disabilities in higher education applications. This lack of confidence, more pronounced among minority groups, has contributed to the exclusion of vulnerable members of the <redacted> community from mechanisms of transitional justice. This outcome, brokered by the project's holistic and inclusive approaches, sets a precedent for marginalized community members to pursue their rights within the existing transitional justice frameworks.
