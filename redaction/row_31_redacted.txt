**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: Following actions led by PAX and its partner OCADES, 60 of the most influential political leaders in the eastern region of Burkina Faso pledged on <redacted> to reconcile and promote peace within their communities.
**Significance of the outcome**: The involvement of political leaders in resolving crises is essential, especially in communities where people identify with their leaders. Because of political differences, political leaders in the <LOC> region no longer saw or spoke to each other. This led to a community crisis between the populations of the local towns and villages. This situation prompted PAX and its partner OCADES to organise consultations and raise the awareness of the region's most influential political and economic leaders so that they would engage in dialogue and commit to restoring peace among themselves and within their communities. The leaders accepted the dialogue and made an official commitment to peace through audio-visual messages calling for peace and unity among the sons and daughters of the eastern region. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: At the end of the consultations and dialogues facilitated by OCADES/CCRGS, 60 political and development leaders agreed to mobilise and launch appeals for peace, understanding and cohesion between the populations of the <redacted> region.

The messages were broadcast on radio and <redacted> in <redacted>. Some leaders told the dialogue forum that they had not sat down with others or greeted each other for <redacted> now.
