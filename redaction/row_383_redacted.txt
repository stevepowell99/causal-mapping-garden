**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted> the  Darfur Civil Society Platform for youths formed indirectly through PAX & Berghoff's initiative joined the  national youth platform called Sudan Youth Network (SYN). The SYN is now the main youth body in Sudan that is actively striving to support ending the war and to realise a civil democratic transformation in Sudan. 
**Significance of the outcome**: This is a significant change. The youth organisations in <LOC> were missing an active platform for youth advocacy on political participation and representation. <LOC> remains one of the most contested regions in Sudan and <LOC> in general. Conflict has never stopped in the area even before the war broke out in 2023, and the recent conflict only made it worse. The Sudan Youth Network has been existing and there were efforts to include youth from <LOC> in <redacted> but it was not fruitful. PAX in partnership with the Berghof <redacted> engaged youth from various civil society initiatives in <LOC>, <LOC>, and <LOC> in <redacted> as part of our So2 outcome 2.3 that intends to forge meaningfuful collaboration and positioning between civilian & pro<redacted> groups calling for the end of the war in Sudan. The engagements were done <redacted> and the <LOC> group used this as an opportunity to continue <redacted> with each other until they formed their own regional network which <redacted> fed into the national network of youth. We are proud to report that the Darfur Civil Society Platform has been very active as they immediately published their first statement against the war and they were well represented in the recently held founding <redacted> of the Sudanese Youth Network for Ending War and Establishing <redacted> in <redacted> in Uganda.

**Contribution of the programme**: This is an <redacted> positive change  mainly because when PAX & Berghof engaged these youth, we had the intention to just create a platform for the youth to talk about their vision and demands on ending the war and possibly meet with some EU delegates working on Sudan. However, these youths from <LOC> took a step further and went on to use this as an opportunity to <redacted> their relations and create a timely needed platform for youths in <LOC>. <LOC> Youth were engaged in a <redacted> online conversation on <redacted> and many issues were raised including the absence of a regional youth platform.﻿
