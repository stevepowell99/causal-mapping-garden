**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On <redacted>, the law on the protection and responsibilities of human rights defenders (HRD) was adopted by the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This bill is composed of thirty articles and provides human rights defenders with rights, duties, obligations and mechanisms. In addition, this bill also sets out the penal provisions to which HRDs and violators of their rights will be subject. 
**Significance of the outcome**: In view of this deficiency and the ongoing violations against HRDs, some provinces have adopted edicts (provincial laws) to ensure the protection of HRDs in their entities, which is why the adoption of the "HRD" law by the National Assembly raises hopes for the effective protection of HRDs. The provincial edits cannot be applied to protect human rigths defenders (HRDs) at national level because provincial edits effective at provincial level. They vary one province to another. The nationwide HRDs law aims at standardizing the HRDs protection across <LOC> of the <LOC> (DRC). When the HRD law is ascended to by the president and it is therefore promulgated, all provincial edits will be null and void to pay way to the HRD law. It should be noted that this process will only be crowned if the Senate, to which it is sent for a second reading, adopts it in turn. Consequently, it will be transmitted to the Head of State for promulgation.
