**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: As a result of physical and digital security <redacted> training in <redacted> and <redacted> for human rights defenders (HRDs) in <LOC>, including the <LOC> region, and institutional support, there is enhanced security and safety for HRDs, improved visibility for national coalitions and improved adherence to security and safety protocols by HRDs for the response and protection of HRDs at risk. 
**Significance of the outcome**: HRDs were increasingly at risk due to their limited knowledge and skills in managing digital and physical security. There were a high number of HRDs at risk due to the use of insecure tools. Training was important to fill the knowledge gap and ensure that HRDs were equipped to prevent most of the risks associated with their physical and online security. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The Réseau Nigérien des Défenseurs des Droits Humains (RNDDH), the Coalition Burkinabé des Défenseurs des Droits Humains (CBDDH) and the Coalition Malienne des Défenseurs des Droits Humains (COMADDH) have developed digital and physical security management plans to protect HRDs at risk and their working tools. <redacted> HRDs Maikul Zodi (Turn the Page, TLP) and <person> (<person>), who were in danger, respected the security protocols developed by RNDDH. <person> (victim of an attempted kidnapping by hooded individuals on a motorbike) and <person> (victim of a call to murder) respected the digital and physical security protocols developed by RNDDH. COMADDH members have adopted a policy of risk assessment prior to any prison surveillance mission. Threats and risks have been considerably reduced.
