**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: To support the organisation of the voluntary return and safe stay of people in their places of origin, the High Commissioner of the province of <person> adopted a participatory protocol defining the <redacted> and <redacted> for return, which came into force on <redacted>. Since 2023, local authorities in the province of <person> have been organising the safe return to and secure retention of people in their localities of origin in <LOC>, <LOC> and <person> (eastern region of Burkina Faso).
**Significance of the outcome**: The <redacted> of <LOC>, <LOC> and <person> are severely affected by the security crisis. In 2022, the village of <LOC> was particularly hard hit by a terrorist attack that disrupted community life. Faced with this situation of high insecurity, nurses working at the health centre and several other people were forced to flee to Fada. Despite the passage of time, the ongoing security threat has prevented their return and the resumption of basic social services such as healthcare and drinking water supply. Ensuring the safety of the population and the functioning of basic social services are essential for a dignified and peaceful community life.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The populations at risk intended to leave the villages. The basic social services, which had become non-existent, did not encourage the return and retention of the population in their communities. Pregnant and breastfeeding women no longer had access to maternal health care. Added to this was the lack of security for both internally displaced persons who wished to return to their communities and those who remained in place.
