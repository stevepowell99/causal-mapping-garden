**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In Burkina Faso since <redacted>, joint committees made up of Peulh, <person> and Mossi have been set up to raise awareness and promote community dialogue on cohesion and living together, for the benefit of members of the villages of <LOC>, <LOC> and <person> in the province of <LOC>, in the <LOC> region
**Significance of the outcome**: The <redacted> of terrorist attacks in 2021 forced the people of <LOC>, <LOC> and <person> to move to Fada. In the various host sites, these people have grouped together into ethnic communities, because from the village a strong mistrust had developed among the ethnic groups. For <redacted>, there was no contact between the different ethnic groups. During the various training courses organised by OCADES in partnership with PAX, the leaders of the different ethnic and religious communities were able to meet several times in the same room to discuss issues of peace and social cohesion. On <redacted>, <redacted> and <redacted>, leaders from the villages of <LOC>, <LOC> and <person> who had taken part in the project's activities organised meetings with members of their respective communities to give feedback on the training they had received and to set up joint committees. These actions taken by the leaders are perfectly in line with the project's objectives.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The setting up of mixed committees is an innovative approach. Since the security crisis, it has been impossible for the different ethnic groups to meet, let alone form mixed groups to raise awareness about living together between different ethnic and religious groups.

**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: During the implementation of the PAX 2023 project, OCADES was able to bring together, around the theme of "promoting ethnic and religious hospitality", leaders from different ethnic and religious communities who had not seen each other for <redacted>. This enabled these leaders to organise a number of meetings to strengthen internal dialogue between the community groups in each village (<LOC>, <LOC> and <person>). The awareness-raising activities carried out by the joint committees have also helped to strengthen cohesion and solidarity between the different ethnic and religious groups. For example, the various religious and ethnic communities in <LOC> have launched a campaign to raise funds to support the most vulnerable. As of <redacted>, food worth a total of 650,000 CFA francs had been purchased for the poorest IDP households and those who had returned to <LOC>.
