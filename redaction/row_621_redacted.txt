**Contribution of the programme**: Our work focused on building trust and social cohesion among young people from different religious and social backgrounds in <LOC>, Fakiha, Jdeideh, <person>, and <person>. We organized interfaith and intercultural dialogue workshops to create safe spaces for youth to share experiences and find common ground. We provided training on community leadership, conflict resolution, and emergency response skills, which enabled young people to take initiative during crises. Additionally, we supported them with resources and mentorship to design and implement their own community projects, such as roundtables, emergency kitchens, site rehabilitation, and recreational activities for children. Continuous follow-up and community networking further encouraged spontaneous collaboration and sustained engagement. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: 1. The strong sense of community solidarity during the war period encouraged young people to step up and help their neighbors regardless of background. 2. Support from local religious and community leaders legitimized and encouraged youth involvement. Intermittent security concerns and the bombing sometimes limited mobility and participation. 3. Economic hardship and limited resources occasionally delayed or restricted project implementation. 4. Mistrust from some older community members required additional efforts to build acceptance and support.
