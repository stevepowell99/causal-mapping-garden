**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Yemen
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <LOC> Governorate, during <redacted> of 2023, police stations began implementing a new approach that involves referring community and family-related cases directly to trained and qualified community mediators, prior to initiating any formal legal procedures.
**Significance of the outcome**: This shift was not merely procedural—it signified a tangible change in the behavior of state institutions toward informal conflict resolution mechanisms. The relationship between the security apparatus and community-based mediators evolved into one of cooperation and trust, paving the way for a more effective, context-responsive, and participatory model. This transformation reflects a “bottom-up” approach, where the initiative originated from local, community-based structures (the mediators) and was subsequently adopted by formal institutions, highlighting the potential of community solutions to influence formal systems from within.
