**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On <redacted>, the Burundian Minister of Justice suspended three judges for <redacted> for negligence and error in handling a case in which a victim of sexual harassment was arrested and detained.
**Significance of the outcome**: The change is significant in that, in addition to the release of the victim, it was followed by the mobilisation of the highest authorities and the imposition of sanctions on the judges. Such direct intervention by the President and his government in a controversial justice case does not happen often. It only happens when there is a massive reaction from the general public and if the case does not affect the upper echelons of power. However, it remains deplorable that political or legislative measures are not taken to ensure that this kind of practice is not repeated in the future.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: On <redacted>, a young female student who had been threatened by the headmaster of the Mugendo local high school to give him sexual favours and was then accused by him, arrested and tried for "revealing professional secrecy", was provisionally released.

Following this, the Minister of Justice suspended the three judges for <redacted>.
