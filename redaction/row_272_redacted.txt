**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In the BF, since <redacted>, there has been a diagnosis of hate messages and alternatives to be promoted in religious circles (<redacted>, <redacted> and <redacted>) 
**Significance of the outcome**: This diagnosis of hate messages was possible thanks to the framework of exchanges created between religious leaders and customary people to discuss concerns and religious differences.  The aim was to address concerns linked to the hate speech used by religious communities during preaching, which has weakened and eroded social cohesion within the communities.  Each community was afraid to broach the subject at the risk of reprisals.  The religious leaders affected have now abandoned the use of hate speech and use appropriate language in preaching and community dialogue.     This effect is linked to one of the programme's change objectives, namely " Communities in <LOC> actively collaborate in a peaceful environment so as to reduce the spread of hate messages and ethnic discrimination." This is important in relation to the programme's objectives because the preaching messages are more inclusive, tolerant and peaceful. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: A forum for religious and traditional leaders has existed since <redacted> to discuss issues of inter-religious conflict. Previously, this framework did not exist. The stakeholders hoped that this framework would be a starting point for setting up a mechanism for managing inter-religious conflict, which has not yet existed in the kingdom of <LOC>.
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: Non-state authorities
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: This effect was achieved thanks to the direct intervention of the project. RAJS/Kaya, a partner of PAX, has initiated this consultation with religious and customary leaders precisely to resolve the lack of a framework for friendly exchange between these players and, above all, to reduce the use of hate speech in places of worship and within the community. To this end, RAJS/Kaya has organised capacity-building for religious leaders on 17 and <redacted>, followed by a round table with traditional leaders on <redacted>. It was precisely this framework that made it possible to record this positive <redacted>e RAJR/Kaya has helped stakeholders to initiate community dialogue during worship or religious festivities, to spread messages of religious tolerance through language. The programme's contribution is positive, because without this framework for dialogue, conflicts arise and persist, and communities live with frustrations without having the possibility of preventing social crises 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The heads of the various religious denominations took an active part in the process by facilitating the effective participation of their members in this framework for dialogue.
