**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: <person>, a businessman and CNDDD-FDD activist, abandoned his plan to carry out a probable extrajudicial execution of <redacted> <person> on <redacted>. 
**Significance of the outcome**: On <redacted>, in <person>, journalist <person> received a call from <person>, alias <person>, an influential businessman close to the government. He intended to offer her an interview on avocado farming. Despite her misgivings, <person> accepted. She disappeared shortly after. It was only during <redacted> that a message, sent from her phone, informed her husband that she would not be returning. The family immediately launched a search, questioning <person> and the security services, without success. <redacted>, a message indicated that she was being held at the headquarters of the National Intelligence Service (SNR) in <LOC>. No authority officially confirmed her detention or the reasons for her arrest. Rumors suggested a connection to the dissemination of information about a suspicious importation of machetes. Her worried family feared mistreatment or forced confessions. <person> became the second female journalist imprisoned in Burundi, after <person>.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: <person> called <person> by phone under the pretext of an interview on his project of planting avocadoes in <person>. While there, <person> narrowly escaped extrajudicial execution. The rescue of <person>, thanks to a rapid citizen alert, highlighted the vulnerability of critical voices, but also the responsiveness of certain non-state actors. This act prevented irreparable harm in a context of widespread impunity. However, in the absence of judicial follow-up or institutional guarantees of non-repetition, this effect remains a one-off. It nevertheless constitutes a symbolically powerful precedent in the fight against serious human rights violations.
