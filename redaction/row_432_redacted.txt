**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, a woman from Bashiqa, along with five other people from <LOC>, Nimrud, and <LOC>, successfully had their compensation requests approved by the compensation department, overcoming previous rejections and suspensions.
**Significance of the outcome**: The communication gap between survivors and government institutions has significantly undermined the ability of thousands of victims to navigate the complex legal procedures necessary to complete an application for compensation.

This lack of awareness and understanding has left thousands of victims without the means to access justice. By directly engaging the most vulnerable groups of society, the project is successful in enabling reparations for victims partaking in initiatives.
