**FragmentID**: SCC-<redacted>/PHR005
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In 2024 and 2025, the <redacted> government first issued amnesty certificates to former LRA fighters and then registered them for the issuance of ID cards (at the time of writing, the ID cards had been delivered to a significant part of the former fighters but not to all). In parallel, the former fighters resettled in northern Uganda and were largely accepted back into their communities (though challenges with regards to acceptance persisted to some degree).
**Significance of the outcome**: The amnesty certificates and ID cards are crucial for the reintegration of the former fighters and their dependents in Uganda society as fully acknowledged citizens. It is also important for them to be able to start small businesses, to claim their rights as citizens, and the ID registration allows the women to return to their home countries for family visits or reunification with their families.               The amnesty and the national ID were two of the main pillars of the peace process.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: While the Amnesty <redacted> had prepared the amnesty documents by <redacted>, the <redacted> army has long delayed the actual issuance to the returnees. During 2024, PAX has had an intensive lobby towards the national authorities for the compliance of the Entebbe agreement (signed agreement of <LOC>, DRC and CAR government and PAX/APRu on the roadmap of the DDRR process).
