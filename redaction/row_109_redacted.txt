**FragmentID**: SCC-<redacted>/CIV007
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Niger
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Through the knowledge acquired during the strategic <redacted> workshop held in <redacted> in <LOC>, Niger, human rights defenders (HRDs) from the <LOC> region learnt about regional mechanisms, including the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court, before which HRDs can lodge complaints for violations of human rights when national mechanisms do not meet their expectations.  It should be noted that, as far as <LOC> is concerned, HRDs do not need to exhaust domestic remedies.  As a result, for the first time in the history of <person> HRDs, the Réseau Nigérien des Défenseurs des Droits Humains (RNDDH) brought case before the <redacted> court, calling on the government of <redacted> to drop the charges against HRD Abdoulaye Seydou and release him.
**Significance of the outcome**: The government of Niger has a history of using the judicial system to arbitrarily arrest and illegally detain human rights defenders in order to silence them.  The monitoring, documentation and reporting of human rights violations and abuses is important for the safety, security and protection of <LOC> citizens and human rights defenders. The Niger Human Rights Defenders Network (RNDDH) is also important for guaranteeing access to justice for human rights defenders who have been arbitrarily arrested and illegally detained. This will enable them to continue to carry out their human rights work.  With the failure of access to justice for human rights defenders at risk through the judicial system in Niger, the use of regional mechanisms becomes very powerful in extending access to justice for human rights defenders and enabling them to continue to do their work.

Human rights defender <person> monitored, documented and reported human rights violations and abuses committed by the <person> military at the <redacted> gold mining site, mistaking fleeing terrorists for gold miners.
