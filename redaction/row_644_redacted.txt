**FragmentID**: SCC-<redacted>/PHR011
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Since <redacted>, religious leaders (<redacted>, <redacted>, traditional and <redacted>) in the municipality of <LOC> in the Kuilse region of Burkina Faso have come closer together, accepted each other and attended the <person> festival together for the first time. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Before 2025, relations between religious denominations in the kingdom of <LOC> were distant, even tense. There was no framework for interfaith collaboration, and <redacted>, <redacted> and <redacted> religious leaders never participated in the festivals or religious activities of other denominations. Each remained confined to their own community, which reinforced prejudices, religious isolation and sometimes underlying tensions. This rapprochement between different religious denominations represents a change in attitudes and practices that breaks with the behaviour of religious communities that have long been characterised by separation, intolerance and mistrust. Achieving dialogue between religions was one of the expected outcomes of the SCC programme.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Following advocacy and outreach efforts by various religious leaders, the President of the FEME (<redacted> of <redacted> and Evangelical Churches) and the parish priest of Kaya Cathedral <redacted> attended <redacted> prayers alongside the <LOC> chief on the occasion of the <person> festival on <redacted>. This is an unprecedented event in the region. This rapprochement between religious leaders, clearly demonstrated by the presence of other faiths at the <person> festival, is likely to influence mutual understanding between followers of the different religious denominations in the municipality. The programme has thus contributed to a profound change in attitudes.
