**Outcome description**: On <redacted>, the <person> governorate office, sent an official decree to all the relevant government employees informing them of the decision to conduct trainings for the relevant employees on digitization and coding, with the aim to eventually establish a digital compensation mechanism for victims.
**Significance of the outcome**: The <LOC> governorate office as well as the department for compensations were previously not interested in digitizing government procedures, as it is a costly process and its value was understimated. There is also a lack of specialized staff in this field. This outcome therefore points to a significant behavorial change. Community consultations conducted by some of the advocates of the newly established network, highlighted recurrent discrimination by government employees as a major obstacle for victims to seek compensation. Fear of social stigma also prevents victims to seek compensation, especially female survivors. Therefore digitizing the compensation procedure would encourage more victims to seek compensation and access their rights, which is one of the main goals of the project's advocacy strategy.
