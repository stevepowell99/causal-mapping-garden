**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In 2022 in particular, MDR work led to higher and increased risks for monitors based in the northern, central-northern and <LOC> regions of Burkina Faso, which have been severely affected by armed conflict.
**Significance of the outcome**: Because of the work of collecting and documenting cases of abuse and human rights violations perpetrated by the FDS & VDP, monitors are identified and perceived as people who support or defend criminals/terrorists and prevent the fight against terrorism by certain authorities but also by the population. This creates a stigma or an environment of insecurity towards them.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Some monitors and human rights defenders are subject to intimidation and threats of abduction in their own communities.
