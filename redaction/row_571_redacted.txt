**FragmentID**: SCC-<redacted>/ESF010
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, <redacted> main opposition party PvdA-GroenLinks unexpectedly switched to supporting a full arms embargo against Israel - two days after PAX handed petition exactly demanding that to MPs. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Since <redacted> voices in society and <redacted> have grown to restrict and, more and more, fully ban arms transfers to Israel. While PvdA-GL supported most of that from early on, it didn't want to back a full arms embargo as it felt Israel should be able to get air defence equipment from NL, as <redacted> had happened twice since <redacted>. While it mentioned publicly that Israel's illegal attack on Iran (enabled by its well-equipped air defence systems) was key to their switching, our arms embargo petition with >30,000 signatures handed over <redacted> (as well as the Red Line demonstartions) played a (supportive) role in their decision to move on. This is significant for the arms trade project as it shows growing support for an arms embargo against Israel, which is an important political signal, similar to measures taken against Russia, Venezuela, Sudan and South Sudan in <redacted>. Obviously, growing parliamentary support should increase pressure on the government to take wider-ranging measures regarding export control to Israel, and more broadly increase pressure on Israel.
