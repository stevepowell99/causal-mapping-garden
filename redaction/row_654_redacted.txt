**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, in <LOC>, Mali, the Malian Government adopted a new Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure, incorporating the recommendations made by OHCHR during the preparatory workshops for the UPR.
**Significance of the outcome**: Previously, the process of drafting the national UPR report was relatively closed, with little or no involvement of civil society organisations (CSOs). Opening up the process to human rights organisations marked an important turning point, strengthening the legitimacy, credibility and quality of the national report. The fact that their recommendations (including the criminalisation of gender-based violence, slavery, human trafficking, sexual harassment and the smuggling of migrants) have been incorporated into the new Criminal Code and Code of Criminal Procedure is a concrete step towards aligning national law with Mali's international human rights commitments.
