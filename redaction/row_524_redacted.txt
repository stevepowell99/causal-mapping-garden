**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, a <redacted> Alawite newcomer participant formed a relationship with a <redacted> participant, fostering a sense of safety and promoting social cohesion in <LOC>.
**Significance of the outcome**:  The <redacted> participant helped the newcomer from Syria find a house to rent and assisted her with moving, which led to them becoming neighbors in <LOC> and thus a support to one another. This is significant given the current context of sectarian sensitivities following the <redacted> regime’s conflict, where some <redacted> residents, particularly among the <redacted> community, are often unwelcoming toward newcomers from Syria, especially Alawites. Despite this, the <redacted> woman participant offered support and helped secure a safe home next to her own. In a context where mistrust and division are deeply rooted, the bond formed between a <redacted> Alawite newcomer and a <redacted> resident is a powerful indicator of change. It not only reflects personal transformation but also challenges entrenched societal narratives. The fact that the <redacted> participant offered tangible support—helping the newcomer find housing and becoming neighbors—shows a significant level of trust and solidarity. This kind of deep, real-world impact is precisely what the project aims to achieve, making the outcome both highly significant and inspiring for replication
