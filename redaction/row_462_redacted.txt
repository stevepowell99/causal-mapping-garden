During these consultations, the government indicated to the MVO platform that they were planning to include references to conflict sensitive due diligence in the text of the <redacted> legislation. 2) This is significant because in conflict-affected and high risk areas, businesses run a high risk of becoming involved with severe human rights abuses. Companies therefore need to conduct 'heightened' or conflict-sensitive human rights due diligence on all their activities and business relationships in these areas. PAX and others advocated for this requirement to be included in mandatory due diligence legislation, both on the EU level as well as in the Netherlands.
