**FragmentID**: SCC-<redacted>/PHR002
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: In <redacted> a trained monitor(from RCP, AINL partner) got a paid job with a local organisation (<redacted>) to do MDR work for an international (IOM) project (on human/child trafficking) in <LOC> as a result of the MDR training. 
**Significance of the outcome**: This is a sign that the MDR capacity-building was of good quality, though it did not immediately benefit the local organisation (RCP). Indirectly, it benefits the organisation (RCP) too, as the monitor now has more income security to be able to continue his volunteer work for the local organisation (RCP). Also, through the international (IOM) project the <redacted> government is also called upon/kept in check.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The monitor applied for a job at the organisation for a UNICEF project; he did not expect to get the job, as he was told that the job was already reserved for a Hutu who is a member of the ruling party. However, his result was so good and the UNICEF representative (a <redacted>) on the recruitment panel was so impressed that they hired him for another project, also an MDR project but then funded by IOM, aside from the designated candidate, who got the job for the original UNICEF project.
