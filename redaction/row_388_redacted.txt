**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, the Voice of Peace radio in Hamdaniya broadcasted a program on the importance of MHPSS 
**Significance of the outcome**: Local media outlets rarely address the needs and priorities of victims. Additionally, institutions and local media do not officially  consider mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) as part of reparation measures for victims and their families, as evidenced by the findings of the community consultations conducted by the network of advocates. The promotion of psychological support culture is increasingly vital considering growing grievances experienced by marginalized communities in <LOC>, which, if ignored, can perpetuate cycles of violence. This need became even more critical in the aftermath of the tragedy in <LOC> <redacted>, where a fire at a wedding hall claimed the lives of approximately 150 people, a disaster attributed to gross negligence by local authorities. Families of the victims, already marginalized by the ISIS invasion and a lack of support, have faced significant mental health challenges since, with little awareness or access to the necessary mental health care. The radio program sets a precedent for insitutions to start acknowledging the importance of MHPSS in rehabilitation efforts and promoting the right tools. It also increases marginalized communities' access to MHPSS, a desired outcome of the project. This also points to the project's ability to directly and effectively address challenges and issues emerging from current events and contextual developments.
