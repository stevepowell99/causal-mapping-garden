**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: Since <redacted>, there is consensus among key government bodies (Specifically the Minister of Justice, the Ethiopian Human Rights Commission, the Ombudsman, Judiciary), on the need for proper documentation and accountability.  
**Significance of the outcome**: Several states in Ethiopia have experienced a prolonged series of armed conflicts, with several reports of sexual violence against women and girls. The conflicting parties have always denied responsibility to CRSV. In 2024, the EHRDC engaged in advocacy to popularize the findings of the research on CRSV among key stakeholders, including state actors and civil societies. These included conversations on the need for documentation and accountability for such violations among the key stakeholders.                                                                                       
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In 2023 a research on CRSV was done by EHRDC. Additionally, 2024 DefendDefenders conducted a training on Communication for Advocacy.
