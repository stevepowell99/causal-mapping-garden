**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: End of <redacted>, the <redacted> <redacted> confirmed that it will start working on national level due diligence legislation. In <redacted>, the European <redacted> published a proposal for EU-wide mandatory due diligence legislation, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. In <redacted>, 6 political parties in the Netherlands re-tabled the parliamentary proposal for national level due diligence legislation.
**Significance of the outcome**: Currently, the international standards on responsible business conduct (the UNGPs and OECD <redacted>) are soft law. Soft law is not effective enough in making companies respect human rights; companies should be obliged by law to conduct human rights due diligence in order to effectively prevent, end and/or remediate adverse human rights impacts. In 2021 and 2022 both the European Commission as well as several member states in the EU have started implementing mandatory due diligence legislation (France, Germany) or have published or announced legislative proposals (the EU, <LOC>).

**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: The step towards mandatory due diligence legislation for companies is largely the result of <redacted> of lobby, advocacy and campaigning by civil society, trade unions and other stakeholders.

On the level of the EU, the European Coalition for Corporate justice (to which the MVO Platform is a member) has played a similar role.
