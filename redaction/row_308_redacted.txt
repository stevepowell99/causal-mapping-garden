**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On <redacted>, in response to questions from MPs, Prime Minister <person> publicly stated that the <redacted> government is in favour of inclusion of the arms sector in the upcoming <redacted> due diligence legislation (CSDDD)
**Significance of the outcome**: Inclusion of the arms sector in the CSDDD was under a lot of pressure during the negotiations on the legislation within the Council. This was the first time that the <redacted> government publicly stated that due to the risks in the downstream value chain of arms companies, this sector should be included in due diligence legislation. In the end the arms sector was -mostly due to France being against it- excluded. However, for future discussions on the review of the legislation, similar kinds of (national level) legislation or on the due diligence responsibilities of arms companies an sich, this statement by the prime minister is meaningful and useful as it strenghtens our advocacy and leverage.
