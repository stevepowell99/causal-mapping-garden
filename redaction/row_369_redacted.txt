**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, the EU Member States and the European Parliament reached a provisional agreement on a final text for the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. It includes language in the recitals on companies' responsibilities to respect IHL and  take into account the heigthened risks in conflict-affected areas in the design and implementation of HRDD.
**Significance of the outcome**: The fact that a provisional agreement was reached by <LOC> in the Council and the European Parliament was an important step forward in the process of developing/adopting the CSDDD (EU-wide due diligence legislation obligating companies to respect human rights). The fact that this provisionally agreed upon final text contained language on the heigthened risks in conflict-affected areas and the need for companies to adapting their due diligence in accordance with this and with the requirements of IHL much increases the chance that the CSDDD, once officially adopted, will indeed require this from companies.
