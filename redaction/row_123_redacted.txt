**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In its revised National Action Plan on Business and Human Rights, published in <redacted>, the <redacted> government has incorporated text on the need for companies to conduct heigthened human rights due diligence in conflict-affected areas and states that it is going to set-up guidelines on this.
**Significance of the outcome**: It shows that the <redacted> government is acknowledging and addressing the fact that companies that are active or have business relationships in conflict-affected areas should take specific, additional due diligence measures to prevent contributing to the high and specific human rights risks at play in these areas. It is however not yet clear how the government is actually going to enforce this (it now only says that it will develop guidelines -which would not be enough; it's not clear whether heigthened human rights due diligence is also going to be included in upcoming legislation). The revised NAP also includes a commitment to collaborating with donors and organizations in making joint analyses which include a gender dimension.
