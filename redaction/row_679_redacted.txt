**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Kenya
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In 2023 following a training in Strategic Advocacy, Feminists for Peace and Rights Justice Centre was able to advocate against Femicide, the protection of women and Adolescent Sexual Reproductive Health Rights (SRHRs) for <redacted>. 
**Significance of the outcome**: In 2023, the Kenyan Parliament tabled the "Family Protection Bill" aimed at protecting the family against homosexuality, abortion and introducing harsher punishments for people and organisations providing services to LGBTIQ persons. It also restricted the registration of NGOs that provide SRHRs services and health services for the LGBTIQ. The bill is still in Parliament and this has increased homophobia, Femicide and targeting of the queer community. The bill increased the targetting of HRDs working on SRHRs as well as those protecting LGBTIQ people . Feminists for Peace and Rights Justice Centre staff have been targeted in their community. The Centre together with other women's movement staff organised the Femicide Match and also stomed a Kenya Ministry of Health policy review meeting that was reviewing the SRHR policy, leading to the adjurnment of the meeting. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The SCC  programme provided a training to HRDs on Strategic advocacy for HRDs. Before the training, we were working in isolation as grassroot organisations and competing with each other. After the training, we were able to build a <redacted> movement to support each other against isolation and promote a spirit of working together. We stormed a meeting that was being held to pass the National <redacted> SRHRs policy by the Ministry of Health. The meeting was abandoned and the policy was deffered. However, the KMoH later organised a second meeting in <LOC> and passed the policy in the absence of the women. While this happened, it went viral and sparked a debate of SRHRs in Kenya and the involvement of other Stakeholders.                                                 The Feminists for Peace and Rights Justice Centre (<LOC>) organised a femicide match to demand for women's safety and <redacted> against femicide in <redacted>. There has been a recorded average death of 6 to 9 women per day in Kenya. The intention is largely to take property, silence women voices and to claim the benefits.
