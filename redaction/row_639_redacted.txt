**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, members of the Rimaïbé and Mossi ethnic groups forgave each other and reconciled, thus avoiding ethnic conflict in <LOC>, in the northern region of Burkina Faso.
**Significance of the outcome**: During a fight in <redacted>, a young <person> stabbed a young <person> in sector 13 of <LOC>. After he was admitted to Ouahigouya Hospital for treatment, the Mossi from Sector 13 met and declared that if their child died from his injuries, no Rimaïbé from Sector 13 would be spared. The Rimaïbé are the butchers of <LOC> and are based in the central market and other markets in the city, as well as in all sectors. In general, an attack on a Rimaïbé from one sector spreads to all Rimaïbé in <LOC>, given the solidarity that exists between them. Informed of the incident, the mediation team composed of AFEDEB and blacksmiths began mediation on the Mossi side through the Chief of Pèla (sector 13) to avoid a confrontation. During the mediation, the victim succumbed to his injuries. Thanks to the mediation that had already begun, the <person> renounced violence but demanded that the Rimaïbé cover the medical expenses incurred for the victim's care. The Rimaïbé agreed and proceeded to pay the expenses through the blacksmiths' leader. The confrontation was avoided and the two parties forgave each other. A delegation from the Rimaïbé went to offer their condolences to the bereaved family. This is important because the work of AFEDEB and the blacksmiths prevented an escalation of violence that could have cost the lives of several other people from both ethnic communities in the town of <LOC>. This change is also in line with OS2 of the programme.
