**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, 5 out of 16 youth from <LOC>, Sudan who were trained in combating mis-information and dis-information in <redacted> demonstrated their skills in countering  false rumours of people from the <LOC> state attacking those from <LOC>, using WhatsApp.
**Significance of the outcome**: With the on going conflict in Sudan, the parties to the conflict (army, militia and the <redacted>) are at the the forefont of spreading false news, plaguing the digital spaces with fake news with the aim of spreading war propaganda. However, Collaborative for Peace through a community based organisation(CBO)- the el Dammar Youth Collaborative, is using strategies such as providing civic education  to young people in the community, and also and providing trainings on online use which are avenues in addressing the spread of false information, one of the major drivers of conflict. While the war was waged for a political purpose (<redacted> regaining the power they lost due to a revolution), disinformation focused on instigating ethnic hate, deeming the fight tribal based. Rumours flooded social media with fake news that people in the rest of the country were attacking tribesmen from <LOC>, and westerners are using hate speech against others. All such disinformation was baseless. Citizens need to be informed of the truth, and the barrage of disinformation and its real objectives gets exposed before the country falls into a civil war.

**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, The youth cited several media platforms/Websites commanding credibility. Youth referred to several posts by journalists and Websites such as <redacted>  , or copied and published what could refute rumors/disinformation, which would be as impartial as non-partisan civil society in its verification of news. They also refered to other journalists, using their own names not parody accounts on social media, who verify and report real news.  
**Rating contribution**: great
**The change was unintended**: NO
**Evidence supporting the outcome statement**: <person> and <person> the staff of Collaborative for Peace, saw these posts by the youths. Point to note is that part of the training taught participants how to ensure their personal safety by deleting any posts that could be self-incriminating if they encountered security services or military intelligence. WhatsApp is the platform they use, where no evidence can be shown of past communication. However, should we receive screenshots of their future postings, we will forward the same to DD and back donors. Facebook ran a huge volume of fake news and disinformation, to which our trainees responded. It takes time to sift through 1000s of responses and comments from <redacted>.
