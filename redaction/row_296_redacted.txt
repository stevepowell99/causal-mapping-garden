**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On <redacted> during the media awareness workshop on civic space violations held in <LOC>, South Sudan organised by <LOC> Human rights Defenders Network (SSHRDN) , 3 Members of Parliament (<person> bonju, <person>, <person>) from the ruling party who were in attendance publicly acknowledged the findings from the report on civic space violations against journalists and human rights defenders (HRDs) to be true and that the NSS and other government  bodies are responsible for the violations . This workshop was the first under the Monitoring, Documentation and Reporting (MDR) project. 
**Significance of the outcome**: For a long time the South Sudan government has been denying reports on civic space violations. It has continously rubbished reports and has made claims that the reports from the civil society are concocted. Attendance of the 3 Members of Parliament(MPs) and their public acknowledgement of the findings in the report can begin to spearhead discussions on civic space in Parliament. The MPs of the constituent assembly shall be able to pass the constitution and remove repressive laws.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The SSHRDN held the media awareness workshop to foster a working relationship between media actors in South Sudan and to also increase awareness to the journalists on the shrinking civic space that they operate in, and encourage them to protect themselves while working. The workshop brought together  a total of 26 HRDs from  across <LOC>, representatives from the Association of media development South Sudan (AMDISS) and Union of Journalists of South Sudan (UJOSS) respectively. These media actors were brought together to contribute to their better coordination. For instance AMDISS is mandated to protect media owners while UJOSS coordinates professional journalists.
