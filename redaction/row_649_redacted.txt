**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: From <redacted>, monitors in the <LOC> district showed their ability to adapt and continued to document human rights abuses and violations, contributing to the organisation's national report despite the blockade imposed on the Ansongo-Menaka road (Mali), which prohibited all movement in and out of the area.
**Significance of the outcome**: At the start of the project, monitors were trained and deployed in the field, each in their own area of coverage. Some monitors were able to spend <redacted> documenting cases. They complained about difficulties in accessing certain areas with a strong presence of terrorist groups and roads where blockades and robberies are quite frequent. Following the second series of training sessions on physical and digital security, the monitors developed the ability to adapt and overcome certain security challenges. Although the monitors' ability to adapt is not an ultimate objective of the project, their role in collecting verifiable information on incidents creates an essential factual basis for conducting advocacy on human rights issues in the area, thereby contributing to the achievement of specific objective 2.
