**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: <LOC>/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: The Burkina Faso authorities are committed to strengthening the <redacted> of human rights and the fight against impunity for the defence and security forces, thanks to the advocacy work carried out by civil society. To this end, on <redacted>, the Transitional Legislative Assembly (TLA) adopted a law amending the code of military justice to take account of the judicial nature of domestic counter-terrorism operations and to improve the management and documentation of offences committed during operations. 
**Significance of the outcome**: As part of the fight against terrorism, the Defence and Security Forces (FDS) and their auxiliaries (the Volunteers for the Defence of the Homeland -VDP) are regularly the subject of allegations of human rights violations, in particular summary and extrajudicial executions, cases of torture, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and enforced disappearances.   The adoption of the law by the TLA marks the will of the State of Burkina Faso to prevent all human rights violations during operations by the defence and security forces against terrorism, but also to gather evidence of any violations so that the perpetrators can be held to account. This represents a step forward in terms of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism and the fight against impunity for the perpetrators of abuses and violations committed in this context.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In view of the reports and allegations of human rights <redacted>, it seemed important to revise the code of military justice to introduce provost marshals even if a state of war has not been declared. This will make it possible to document offences committed during <redacted> and thus allow the presence of judicial police officers in military groups and detachments present in conflict zones (judicialisation of theatres of <redacted>), to protect military personnel operating in the field and also to protect civilians. On <redacted>, the Burkina Faso government adopted a draft bill in the Council of Ministers to create provost marshals in theatres of operation. The provost marshals are intended to solve the problem of the lack of investigation and judicial handling of allegations of human rights violations and abuses committed by the SDF and terrorist groups. They also make it possible to have sufficient evidence to clear a person of alleged offences, or rather to charge him or her on the basis of this evidence. This would make it possible to try detainees for terrorist offences fairly quickly, and to combat long waiting times and prison overcrowding. It remains important to continue monitoring human rights in conflict zones to better assess the application and effects of the new law on the ground.
