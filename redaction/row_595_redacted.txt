**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: On <redacted>, the Dutch Embassy in <LOC> requested and oversaw the organization of an in-person donor briefing with RPW and multiple international stakeholders.  
**Significance of the outcome**: This marked a shift from 2024, when RPW had independently organized an online donor briefing. Previously, donor engagement with refugee-led analysis in Lebanon was limited and largely driven by civil society actors, with diplomatic missions like the Dutch Embassy rarely initiating follow-up or deeper involvement. By initiating an in-person donor briefing with RPW, inviting other international donors, the Dutch Embassy in <LOC> acknowledged particular reliability, access and expertise of RPW by way of proactively associating themselves with a refugee-led coalition. The change is significant because it indicates increased recognition of RPW’s credibility, ability to build and maintain strong relations and ultimately influence, enabling stronger advocacy on refugee protection ahead of critical decision-making moments and during a volatile situation in Lebanon and Syria. The change also reflects deeper engagement by a key diplomatic actor in RPW’s evidence-based advocacy work as well as increased trust in the work of the coalition in specific and in civil society in general.
