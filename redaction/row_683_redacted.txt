**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, HURIA and HSI made - for the first time - a joint <redacted> on Enforced Disappearances (ED) and Extrajudicial <redacted> (EJEs) to the United Nations' Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process. The <redacted> presented recommendations based on evidence collected from 33 cases, <redacted> in <LOC>, <person> and <LOC> counties between <redacted>.
**Significance of the outcome**: The UPR is a very important process for advancing the realization of human rights <redacted>, <redacted> and globally. HURIA and HSI had never engaged in the UPR process as an advocacy strategy. The <redacted> UPR training represented a critical step toward strengthening the organizations' ability to effectively participate in international human rights mechanisms. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Since the UPR Training there is now an enhanced knowledge and appreciation of the UPR process as a key advocacy tool for ED concerns. There is also an increased HURIA and HSI commitment and enthusiasm to actively engage in the future UPR process and follow up of the outcomes. HURIA and HSI had previously not engaged in the UPR process and mechanisms. By equipping staff with a deeper understanding of the Universal Periodic Review (UPR) process, relevant procedures, and engagement strategies, HURIA and HSI can now strategically position themselves to raise local human rights concerns on a global platform. Significantly, this outcome strengthens HURIA and HSI role as both a watchdog and a bridge between local communities and the international human rights system, enhancing the likelihood of tangible policy reforms and improved protection of rights in their respective counties. The experience has strengthened  HSI's and HURIA's networking abilities with other UPR coalition partners, and their collaboration with other partners based in <LOC> continues to expand.
