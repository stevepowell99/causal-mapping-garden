**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, international NGOs such as Oxfam and Independent Diplomat started co-organizing regional roundtables with refugee-led organizations (RLOs) in <LOC> and MENA ahead of the High-Level Officials Meeting (HLOM) in <LOC>.
**Significance of the outcome**: Previously, refugee-led organizations (RLOs) were largely confined to consultative roles in international advocacy spaces, with limited influence over agenda-setting or event organization. Partnerships with INGOs rarely extended to co-design or shared leadership. This shift is significant because it demonstrates meaningful recognition of RLOs as equal partners, aligning with RPW’s objective to advance localization and refugee leadership. It also increases the visibility and legitimacy of refugee-led advocacy at high-level policy forums like the HLOM.
