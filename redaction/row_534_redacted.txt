**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In <redacted>, following a <redacted> with  CAC, the UN <redacted> of Inquiry (COI) on <LOC> (Navi Pillay (Chair) and <person>) agreed to re-evaluate its analysis of the root causes of recurring tension and instability between <LOC> and <LOC>. The commissioners expressed openness to <redacted> their position and, in <redacted> communication, indicated their intention to publish a revised framework in <redacted>. 
**Significance of the outcome**: This outcome is highly significant as it represents a potential paradigm shift in how the UN’s highest investigative body on Palestine frames the root causes of the conflict. If the revised framework includes a recognition of <redacted> as a structural root cause, it would mark a historic acknowledgment within the UN system, one that could reshape international legal and political discourse on Palestine. CAC’s ability to influence this shift demonstrates the growing credibility and strategic impact of <redacted> civil society actors in high-level international mechanisms.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In its initial reports, the COI identified two primary root causes: the prolonged occupation and a climate of impunity. CAC, along with other NGOs, consistently challenged this framing, arguing that it failed to address <redacted> as a root cause. For a period, the dialogue with the COI’s staff appeared stalled. However, CAC succeeded in securing a direct meeting with the commissioners themselves. During this meeting, CAC emphasized the analytical gap in the COI’s framing and advocated for a more accurate and historically grounded understanding of the root causes. The commissioners’ subsequent openness to revisiting their analysis marks a significant shift. Confirmation of their intent to publish a revised framework came via a phone call with <person>, Head of Staff for the COI.
