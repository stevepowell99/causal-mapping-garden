**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On Sunday 24 September 2022, the military state actors of Sudan via Sudan state media agreed to the pressure of CSOs to halt the announced burial of several unidentified dead bodies who had been in the morgue since 2019 without conducting an autopsy by international experts.  
**Significance of the outcome**: This is a significant outcome because,this still gives hope for closure and right to know for families of the victims. Since 2019 when a commision to investigate these mass killings by security actors during the revolution was established by the Transitional Government which included military and civilain actors, the committe did not manage to release the full report because of the ineterfence of the military actors and eventually the coup. In March 2022, the committee was also forced to pause its activities after its office was seized by security forces. They prevented the committee's employees from entering the premises and from taking any equipment belonging to the committee. After several meetings, September 25 2022 was set as the date for the start of autopsies in preparation for burial according to strict procedures and in compliance with the protocol of the International Red Cross in dealing with unknown bodies.Hence, this action by CSOs taking matters in their hands is critical in making sure that justice is pursued and victim groups are listned to, which is in line with PAX and AI So2 in the ToC.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: During the 2019 revolution that toppled the 30 year rule of Bashir in Sudan, on the 3rd of June 2019, over 180 protesters were killed by the security state actors in Khartoum. The security opened live ammunition on the huge crowds and most of the bodies were thrown in the river Nile and some burried in mass graves. Some of the bodies were later retrieved from the graves and Nile River during the transitional period, and up to now they are all scattered and decomposing in various mortuaries in the capital Khartoum. Families of the victims have been asking for DNA tests to get closure on their missing members, but the government has been refusing. The families have been consistently told there were no unclaimed bodies in mortuaries. In September 2022, the coup government/military actors announced that they will officially bury the bodies in mass graves without conducting DNA tests in a move to conceal any evidence. This angered many people in Sudan especially the families of the victims. The burial was an attempt to evade justice and truth recovery, because most of the high ranking officials would have been implicated in this massacre. Following various CSO campaigns, mainly led by PAX PoV partners, the burial was halted, and government agreed to conduct an autopsy on the bodies.
