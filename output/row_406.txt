**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2312/PHR022
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Following a training in physical and digital security conducted in October 2022, and mentorship in effective protection case management, the national HRD coalitions in Burkina Faso, Mali and Niger, have between July and November 2023 supported access to emergency protection for 12 HRDs at risk enabling them to continue working safely 
**Significance of the outcome**: Sahel has continued to witness shrinking space for operations of HRDs. HRDs are constantly at risk due to their engagement in HR work and with intentions to have them silenced. In 2023, there was an increase in the demand for protection support from HRDs. This has left many HRDs in distress, and at risk of percecussion due to limited emergency protection mechanisms in the region. Also, in the previous years, the coalitions limited capacity in managing protection cases for HRDs at imnent risk. Following the trainings in protection, physical and digital security, and mentorship on protection case management by DefendDefenders, the national coalitions are now able to receive and support protection cases. This is important to the objective of the programme as HRDs must continue to work in a safe and secure environment despite the drastic reduction in civic space.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: DD's mentorship and institutional support to national coalitions has resulted in balance, sustainability and credibility of the coalitions with international partners and CSOs. In Burkina Faso, the national coalition coached the focal point responders (partnership organisation) to relocate the 03 women HRDs to the Sahel region in the North. The coalition has also improved its practices in cross-border cases through sub-regional mechanisms for the protection of HRDs such as UBUNTU Hub cities and the West African Network of Human Rights Defenders (ROADDH). In Mali, the national coalition acts as a relay between HRDs and the National Human Rights Commission, which is also the national mechanism for the protection of human rights defenders. She is also solicited by other coalitions of foreign HRDs such as the Senegalese coalition of HRDs to assist HRDs in exile in Mali.
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: Civic change agents
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: The programme facilitated trainings of the members of the national coalitions and other HRDs. Similarly, the programme supported the mentorship and institutional support to national coalitions. This has resulted in better ability of the coalitions to analyse civic space, be able to adequately receive and assess protection cases for HRDs at risk as well as extend protection support. The programme also contributed to funds for emergency protection. In Burkina Faso, for example, the national coalition coached the focal point responders to relocate the 03 women HRDs to the Northern Sahel region. The programme also supported cross boarder protection of HRDs through the UBUNTU Hub cities and the West African Network of Human Rights Defenders (ROADDH) as sub-regional mechanisms.  
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The Ubuntu Hub cities have been responsible for supporting exiled HRDs
