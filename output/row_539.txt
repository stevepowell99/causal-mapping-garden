**FragmentID**: SCC-IRQ2508/GEQ024
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Between 2022 and 2025, PFO and project's grantees in Ninewa (volunteer CBOs) collaborated on and carried out approximately 33 joint activities (both within and outside the framework of the project) including inclusive intiatives targeting diverse indentities. 
**Significance of the outcome**:  The CBOs preferred to submit some proposal as consortium for better events, and this was not directly facilitated by PFO. Representatives from these CBOs often came from identity groups that are normally in conflict with each other. These inclusive initiatives organized and targeted diverse identities, both within and beyond the project framework. Additionally, some advocates formed dedicated working groups focused on media campaigns and women's issues initiatives. Sustained collaboration fostered diverse, issue-focused activism beyond the project
