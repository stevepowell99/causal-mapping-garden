**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: On 14 December 2024, after reconciliation efforts, members of the Christian and Muslim religious communities in the village of Nagré in the province of Gourma, who had been at odds after a Muslim son of the village targeted the Christian community during the distribution of food aid, decided to set up a community committee Sougrimani, responsible for collecting and distributing food in an inclusive and participatory manner.
**Significance of the outcome**: In May 2025, an imam from Nagré living in Ouagadougou generously sent two tonnes of food to support vulnerable people in his home village. However, when the donations arrived, a crisis quickly arose over the identification of the beneficiaries. Peace and stability within the intervention communities contribute to the achievement of the SCC programme's objectives.
