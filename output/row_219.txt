**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In December 2023, 60% of the trained Burundian HRDs and CSOs in exile in Rwanda trained in security management implemented the security protocols, and reduced the risk of potential security breaches on their organisations' data.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before the training, participants had minimal experience in both HRD work and in digital security management. The HRDs were not mindful of the security risks associated with using public equipment like computers to do confidential HRD work as there was a lack of  awareness of these potential risks. The training allowed them to; gain a deeper understanding of digital threats and vulnerabilities, acquire practical skills and tools to protect digital assets, and cultivate a security-conscious culture. Following the training, they only used private equipment for their HRD work. For example, several participants were found to have transitioned to using their personal laptops or phones rather than public ones, to develop organization reports, enhancing data security. This shift minimizes the risk of unauthorized access to the HRDs’ information, and other potential security breaches.
