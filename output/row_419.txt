**FragmentID**: SCC-SSU2312/CIV038
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On 21 February 2023, South Sudan President Salva Kiir and the First Vice President Riek Machar agreed to remove sections 54 and 55 in the National Security Service (NSS) Act that give the institution unconstitutional powers to arrest without and with a warrant. During the multi stakeholders meeting held on 2 November 2023 and organised by South Sudan Human Rights Defenders Network (SSHRDN), the same was confirmed by the former chief whip of the Parliament, though there is still resistance at the Parliament to agree with the removal of the sections.
**Significance of the outcome**: The NSS Act currently gives NSS police the powers to arrest and detain HRDs. Human rights organizations have documented human rights violations by the NSS including arbitrary arrests and prolonged detention, including of political opponents and government critics. The decision to scrap the 2 articles is a positive step in the process of limiting the powers of the NSS and stopping repression of (W)HRDs.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: While the President and the First Vice President of South Sudan agreed to scrap sections 54 and 55 in the NSS Act, this agreement was not made public. However, the SSHRDN acknowledged the President for this positive step through a statement on their website  welcoming his decision to check the powers of the NSS. During the multistakeholders meeting, the Members of Parliament in attendance reported that the ammendment bill (NSS) was brought back to the parliament for 2 readings but it is yet to be discussed.Currently, the 2 sections (54 and 55) are still in effect.
