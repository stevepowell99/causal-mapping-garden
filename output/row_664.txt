**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Ethiopia
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: EHRDC has a better operational capacity in 2025 to protect HRDs at risk in Ethiopia
**Significance of the outcome**: Since 2019, EHRDC has had numerous challenges in effectively responding to HRDs at risk due to limited staff, an unclear organizational structure, and transport challenges. Between 2023 and 2024, the center received institutional support that enabled the development of an organizational structure, a contribution to staff salaries and welfare, and the acquisition of a vehicle to easily transport HRDs at risk for their safety. Additionally, this support strengthened the IT infrastructure as well as mentorship for EHRDC's staff to improve program efficiency and effectiveness.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: EHRDC secured funds to maintain a competent staff to implement the program and ensure the continuity of the organization, including salary contributions. The center acquired a reliable vehicle to enhance fieldwork and logistics, established a robust organizational structure to streamline operations, developed a context-specific salary scale designed to attract and retain competent local talent amidst economic challenges, and conducted a much-needed wellbeing session for its staff, demonstrating a commitment to their welfare in a demanding environment. On 25th December 2024, EHRDC was suspended by the Federal Democratic Republic of Ethiopia authority for civil society organizations (ACSO) for allegedly deviating from its founding objectives, lacking independence, and failing to maintain transparency in its organizational structure. As a data safety measure, EHRDC had transferred all HRD-related information to the harddisk purchased by Defenddefenders.
