**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In August 2023, Mrs. "N" underwent a significant personal transformation, discovering and embracing her talent for drawing after participating in community group sessions specifically session related to advocacy at the Tyre Model Center in her local community. As a result of her participation, she began creating artwork to summarize discussions during committee meetings.
**Significance of the outcome**: Women and girls from areas in the South are raised in patriarchal communities where their rights to engage in artistic activities is often forbidden. By fully engaging in community groups trainings to build their capacities on advocacy and gender, Mrs. "N" felt empowered and confident to embrace her dormant talent for drawing and attributed this shift in behavior to the encouragement and supportive atmosphere of the sessions. Mrs. "N's" family had long discouraged her from expressing her artistic abilities. This outcome is significant because it demonstrates the importance of the trainings not just on community levels but also on personal level, and symbolizes the transformative power of providing women and girls with the tools and support they need to assert their rights and pursue their passions.
