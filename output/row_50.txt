**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Throughout 2022, a volunteer team representing the Kakai component participated in organizing three activities within the project.
**Significance of the outcome**: this is the first time Kakai members of society in Ninewa participate in civil society initiatives after the invasion of ISIS. The kakai sect is a very small minority group in Iraq that is heavily discriminated against especially from authorities as the sect is not officially recognized in Iraq. They suffered grave human rights atrocities at the hands of ISIS, but were rarely included or represented in the work of civil society in the region. Their inclusion in the project gave the space for this marginalized component of Ninewa to tackle prejudice directed towards them and to share their experiences and grievences with the rest of society, thereby contributing to more inclusive transformative justice processes
