**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In July 2022, Burundian survivors of sexual violence who took refuge in Uganda created an association of victims as a support system for their own recovery and well-being. 
**Significance of the outcome**: For a long time burundian men and women survivors of violence were forgotten with minimal support and have lived with the trauma with no hope. The fact that they have formed an association demonstrates that the survivors have gained confidence, are organising themselves to stand up for their rights and support each other.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: A research study conducted and published by Light For All in March 2022, titled "I wish I was not born; The Scope of Conflict Related Sexual Violence among Burundian refugee men and women in the Burundi Conflict". The research was conducted with funding through DD, and was followed in July 2022 by a capacity building programme which was done in partnership with the Global Fund for Survivors (created by Denis Mukwege and Nadia Mourad). After those two interventions, the survivors created an association of victims as a support system in the recovery and well-being. The survivors gave testimonies of hope after the training. There was enhanced capacity for Burundian refugee men and women on reparation opportunities for survivors of CRSV living in exile in Uganda. The survivors gained hope and confidence that justice will be done and that they can access reparation and rehabilitation services. This followed the research study conducted and published by Light For All in March 2022,   titled " I wish I was not born" The Scope of Conflict Related Sexual Violence among Burundian refugee men and women in the Burundi Conflict.
