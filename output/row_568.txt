**Significance of the outcome**: •	This outcome is very important to our work as it has improved access to the remote Mukaya Payam.  •	It has also improved security for partners and community and allowed people of Mukaya who fled from the violence across country border to return to their home lands. •	Improved food security for the people we serve as result of access to their farmlands.  •	Access to education of thousands of children 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Mukaya is one of the Six counties in Central Equatoria. Inhabited by Mostly Pojulu tribe. Around 2010, reports suggest that some intellectuals from the community decided to leased the whole land to Investors and the most respected an uneducated  chief  was tricked to signed an agreement for the land lease. Unknowingly, the chief signed the land lease agreement and later the investors came demanding for their land. This was when the chief knew he was tricked to sign an agreement without his consciousness. He was very angry and cursed himself to die if indeed he was awareness of the agreement or else curse on the land. When 2016 conflict broke out, Mukaya became a hideout of three rebel groups (the National Salvation Front-NAS, the Sudan People Liberation Movement In-Opposition- SPLM/A- IO, the South Sudan National Movement for Change).  These armed groups occupied three bomas of Mukaya and Government forces were in control of only one boma. All the armed groups accussed the civilians in either side of the being supporters of their enemies. The situation left the civilians with no option but fled the Mukaya and became Internally displaced people in Yei areas of Atende and Gezira.  The civilians maintained their separate IDP camps. The communities of Mukaya belief that all these calamities came because of the curse that was pronounced by the chief and hence it needed traditional solution.  Unfortunately, the chief who pronounced the curses passed on and the task was left with his son and the community had to convene the son to perform the traditional cleansing. If failing to perform the cleansing, it will prevented people from returning to Mukaya. Hence it was important to do it in order to allow people of Mukaya to resettle.   In 2022, the traditional and religious leaders  of Mukaya approached RECONCILE to help their divided communities due to the conflict to facilitate community dialogue for the communities of Mukaya according to the leaders, their communities have been in a bitter relationship for nearly seven years, killing each other, accusing each other as being rebel supporters to the government machineries.
