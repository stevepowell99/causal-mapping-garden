**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In December 2024, for the first time, 35 Sudanese participants (ages 18–51) in Kampala, Uganda, representing youth and human rights organizations, formed four working groups (Media, Legal Support, Documentation, Research) to coordinate advocacy for victims of forced disappearance during Sudan’s April 15th war.
**Significance of the outcome**: Since the war began on April 15, 2023, there has been a sharp rise in enforced disappearances, particularly in areas affected by Rapid Support Forces (RSF) and Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) conflict. However, documentation and justice mechanisms inside Sudan have collapsed. Additionally CSO efforts inside and outside Sudan have been plorised by the war or affected by the funding cuts, therefore there had been no efforts to streamline inside and outside human rights bodies working on enforced dissapearances. This effort fills a critical void, helping to build future legal cases and mobilize global attention.The initiative is led by Sudanese activists and civil society, many of whom are directly affected or closely connected to the victims. This grassroots leadership enhances the legitimacy, trust, and contextual understanding of the issue, ensuring that advocacy reflects the realities on the ground. By forming dedicated working groups—Media, Legal Support, Documentation, and Research—the participants are building a coordinated and strategic response. Each group tackles a critical aspect of the enforced disappearances crisis:  Media raises awareness and keeps the issue visible.  Legal Support seeks justice and accountability mechanisms.  Documentation preserves evidence and personal stories for future use.  Research deepens understanding of patterns and perpetrators.

**Contribution of the programme**: On 7-12-2024, the Center of Victims of Forced Disappearance- Missing Persons Initiative invited 35 Sudanese individuals aged (18–51) representing diverse youth and human rights organizations in Kampala, Uganda for a workshop on enforced dissapearances in Sudan. The main objective is to coordinate and amplify efforts among initiatives and human rights bodies to address the issue of Forced disappearances amidst the April 15th war. This workshop was the one that directly led to the formation of this network.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: No, to our knowledge there are no actors that initiated a similar or were instrumental in shaping this workshop. Organisations such as the African centre for Justice and Peace Studies (ACJPS), and United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) in Sudan also work on enforced dissapearances and linking partners, but this was solely an effort of CVED (this Missing Iniative).
