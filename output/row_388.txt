**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In November 2023, the Voice of Peace radio in Hamdaniya broadcasted a program on the importance of MHPSS 
**Significance of the outcome**: Local media outlets rarely address the needs and priorities of victims. Additionally, institutions and local media do not officially  consider mental health and psychosocial support (MHPSS) as part of reparation measures for victims and their families, as evidenced by the findings of the community consultations conducted by the network of advocates. The promotion of psychological support culture is increasingly vital considering growing grievances experienced by marginalized communities in Ninewa, which, if ignored, can perpetuate cycles of violence. This need became even more critical in the aftermath of the tragedy in Hamdaniyya last year, where a fire at a wedding hall claimed the lives of approximately 150 people, a disaster attributed to gross negligence by local authorities. Families of the victims, already marginalized by the ISIS invasion and a lack of support, have faced significant mental health challenges since, with little awareness or access to the necessary mental health care. The radio program sets a precedent for insitutions to start acknowledging the importance of MHPSS in rehabilitation efforts and promoting the right tools. It also increases marginalized communities' access to MHPSS, a desired outcome of the project. This also points to the project's ability to directly and effectively address challenges and issues emerging from current events and contextual developments.

**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: In 2022, PFO supported the MHPSS pilot in Bashiqa, which allowed the staff to gain significant knowledge around MHPSS. This experience, coupled with insights gained from dealing with victims on a daily basis, allowed the staff to identify the crucial need to integrate MHPSS in all aspects of the project and not only as a stand-alone intervention. This influenced the overall revision of the project's MHPSS strategy during the mid-term review. In the meatime, PFO staff decided to increase their efforts in MHPSS, thereby selecting the Shalama Psychological support team as an additional grantee funded by the project. In November 2023, the Shalama Psychological Support team, with the support of the Peace and Freedom Organization, held a workshop on psychological first aid in Hamdaniyya, and the director of Radio Al-Salam in Hamdaniya was among the attendees and listened to the concerns of the Hamdaniya community and the psychological traumas experienced by survivors and families of victims in the fire.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: There are prior relationships between the grantees and the radio, but this initiative encouraged the release of this episode with the support of Shalama.
