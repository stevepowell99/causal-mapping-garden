**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2508/PHR029
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In 2024, in the Koro district of Mali, an MDR project monitor documented the abduction of eight members of a local NGO by armed groups and took the initiative to participate in the mediations that led to their release.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before participating in the MDR project, the trainer was not directly involved in resolving security incidents. This change is important because it shows that the MDR project has strengthened not only the technical capacity of trainers to document violations, but also their confidence and role as protection actors in the field. This contributes directly to the MDR programme's objectives of strengthening the security and resilience of human rights defenders in high-risk contexts.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: This effect demonstrates that the MDR project has enabled a shift from a strictly documentary approach to a proactive approach, where monitors become actors in crisis response. This is particularly innovative and relevant in a context such as Mali, where local NGOs work in areas with high security risks.
