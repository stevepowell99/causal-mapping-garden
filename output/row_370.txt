**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Kenya
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In November 2023, at the 77th Ordinary Session of the African Commission on Human and Peoples' Rights (ACHPR), in Arusha, Tanzania, a resolution was passed  to conduct a regional study to assess the conformity of national laws in Africa with the Guidelines on Freedom of Association and Assembly in Africa.
**Significance of the outcome**: Several governments on the Continent have enacted laws that curtail Freedom of Association and Assembly. These laws curtail the work of HRDs and increase the risk in engaging in human rights work. With WHRDs engaging at ACHPR, it provided an opportunity to highlight and profile the challenges HRDs face in engaging on the Freedom of Association and Assembly. The WHRDs presented an oral statement demanding the ACHPR to compel African governments to respect the right to life, freedom of the media, right to protest, freedom of peaceful assembly, access to information and expression.                                     
**Additional information (use if needed) **: With increasingly shrinking civic space and limited Freedom of Association and Assembly, HRDs working to raise concerns on human rights violations have been threatened with attacks and killings for example; in Baringo and Kericho regions. In one of the referenced instances, a HRD who was a whistle blower and raised a concern of human rights violations by a multi-national tea farm to the British Broadcasting Company for documentation and investigation was killed. Another HRD, a peace ambassador dealing with cattle rustling was also killed. Defenders Coalition Kenya wanted to extert pressure on the ACHPR to make a recommendation to the government of Kenya to adopt the draft Model Human Rights Protection Policy that has been stuck at the Attorney General's Office since 2020. With the concerns raised the ACHPR resolved to conduct a study on Freedom of Association and Assembly in Africa.
