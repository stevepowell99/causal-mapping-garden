**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: Between May 15 and November 15, 2024, the U.S. Special Envoy to Sudan held 2 meetings with Alharissat in Kampala, recognizing her role as a respected community leader and advocate for women's political participation. 
**Significance of the outcome**: This marked a shift in diplomatic engagement, as the Envoy acknowledged Alharissat’s influence and legitimacy in representing women’s voices in Sudan’s peace and political processes. During the visit, they also jointly reviewed and discussed the agenda for an upcoming workshop scheduled as part of the Taqqadum conference, ensuring that women’s priorities would be reflected. The Envoy expressed support for these goals and highlighted the importance of sustained U.S. engagement with women-led civil society as a cornerstone of democratic transformation in Sudan. This meeting underscores Alharissat’s growing political relevance—not only within Sudan but also on the international stage. It reflects a shift in how feminist, community-based organizations are being perceived: not as peripheral actors, but as essential partners in shaping inclusive and sustainable political outcomes. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The U.S. as a Key Power Broker in Sudan’s Peace and Political Processes, The United States has played a central role in shaping Sudan’s peacebuilding and democratic transition efforts for over two decades. Notable interventions include: •	The Comprehensive Peace Agreement (CPA) in 2005 between North and South Sudan, where the U.S. acted as a lead mediator alongside IGAD. •	U.S. support for the 2019 civilian-military power-sharing agreement, following the ouster of Omar al-Bashir. •	Ongoing involvement in mediation efforts between SAF and RSF since the April 2023 conflict, including participation in the Jeddah Talks. Thus, U.S. recognition signals legitimacy and influence, especially for non-state or grassroots actors like Alharissat. When the U.S. chooses to engage a local feminist movement, it signals that community-driven, women-led approaches are being taken seriously as part of the peace equation. B. Influence Over Transitional Civilian Platforms like Taqqadum The U.S. maintains strong diplomatic and funding ties with Sudanese civilian platforms, including Taqqadum. Alharissat’s dialogue with the U.S. Special Envoy indicates a strategic effort to leverage U.S. influence to push Taqqadum toward gender inclusivity. Given the U.S.’s ability to apply diplomatic pressure and condition aid, this connection can directly impact Taqqadum’s internal dynamics and policy directions.

Advancing a Unified Feminist Agenda: As a result of the women’s conference, Alharisat hosted a follow-up conference in September 2024, focusing on the need for a unified feminist agenda and the revival of the December 2019 revolution’s spirit. This event was made possible through U.S. funding and partnerships with various international embassies. 3.	Global Advocacy at the United Nations: On the 4th of October 2024, with PAX support, Alharisat’s Executive Manager, Hadia, played a key role at a side event during the 79th United Nations General Assembly (UNGA79) in New York.

Hadia’s advocacy and evidence presentation contributed significantly to the extension of the UN Fact-Finding Mission (FFM) mandate for Sudan, a crucial step towards accountability and justice. While this achievement was the result of collective efforts by various INGOs, Sudanese NGOs, and UN bodies, Alharisat played a critical role in the process
