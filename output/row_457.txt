**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: From May 26–30, 2024 during a Taqqadum (a civilian body leading national efforts to stop the war in Sudan) conference in Addis Abba, the female branch was created. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The inclusion of women within the Taqqadum platform through the establishment of the female branch is a significant step forward in advancing women's political participation in Sudan’s post-conflict context. Taqqadum is composed of four key groups, including a civilian group that plays a central role in shaping the national political discourse. For the first time, women were given the opportunity to speak on behalf of the civilian group, marking a breakthrough in accessing high-level political spaces traditionally dominated by men. This platform is the first national-level civilian body representing diverse regions and actors across Sudan. Although full inclusion of women is still a work in progress, the achievement of securing 40% female participation—including women in leadership roles—demonstrates meaningful progress toward gender inclusivity. It reflects a growing recognition of women's roles not only as advocates for peace but also as key political actors in shaping Sudan’s future. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Sudanese women were largely excluded from elite negotiations after the 2021 coup and throughout the ongoing conflict. The establishment of the branch signals a corrective measure—addressing the gender gap and ensuring women's perspectives are part of the decision-making structures shaping Sudan’s future.

**Contribution of the programme**: From May 6–8, 2024, a workshop was held in Kampala facilitated by Harissat under the PoV entitled, "Enhancing Women's Political Participation and Representation." , marking the first time women activists from different regions of Sudan convened in person since the outbreak of the war.  The workshop provided a critical space for dialogue, despite initial tensions caused by differing interpretations of the war’s origins and civilian interventions. Through the workshop, participants agreed to respect diverse perspectives and focus on shared priorities. This shift in attitude contributed to a more collaborative atmosphere, which led to the formation of a women’s network. This workshop played a catalytic role in unifying women activists around a common agenda and vision. It served as the first step in structuring the women’s network, fostering mutual understanding, and promoting consensus on the need for collective action to advance peace in Sudan. As a result of this cohesion, the participants agreed that women should actively engage in the existing Taqqadum political platform to enhance female representation. Following the workshop, the women carried out lobbying and advocacy efforts that contributed to achieving a commitment for up to 40% women's participation within Taqqadum’s structures.  
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, many national and international organistaions such as women of Tgaddum, women from: political parties and armed movements, UN Women, Resistance Committees, and professional associations were part of the conference that lobied for this outcome. This platform became the main women's platfdor that was directly working with various other women groups that were pushing for women political participation in Taqaddum. The conference was supported and organised by PAX partner Alharrisat, who had worked already with many grassroots women groups before, hence it was not a challenge to bring diverse groups together. However, it's important to note that this platform was made up of many women groups but did not represent all women’s groups in Sudan. Some groups chose not to join, either because they did not support the idea of Tagaddum or were simply not interested in joining this women's coalition.
