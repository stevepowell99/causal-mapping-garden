**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In May 2025, a young woman from Mosul (Arab Muslim)  who is the Head of Ninewa Women Organization, submitted to be a candidate in the elections of 2025. She joined a political party "national identity party" which is led by a military group in Al-Hashd Al-Sha'abi, seeking their support.
**Significance of the outcome**: This outcome highlights a concerning trend in which young women leaders, despite their potential to advance inclusive civic participation, are compelled to align with militarized political forces due to the limited influence and protection of independent civil society. It reflects the shrinking civic space and the dominance of political-military actors, which undermines transformative justice by reinforcing power hierarchies, reducing accountability, and co-opting grassroots leadership into partisan structures.
