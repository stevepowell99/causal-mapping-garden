**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In June 2024, 7 Sudanese CSOs together with the Sudan's Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights(OHCHR), the Institute for Security Studies ISS and a survivor of enforced dissapearance in Sudan contributed to the launch and design of the هنعشا "For Their Sake" ( مَ ) campaign on enforced disapearances in Sudan.
**Significance of the outcome**: This was a significant outcome of a 3 days workshop because it assisted in  openning the space to a wide range of grassroots Sudanese civic actors to engage, think out of the box, and co-own and cooperate to lead advocacy & campaign efforts against ED & other human rights abuses in Sudan. Organisations invited to participate in this workshop included representatives from, ACJPS, Sudanese Democratic Lawyers, Radio Dabanga, Sudanese Group of Victims of Enforced Disappearance, Sudanese Doctors Union & survivors of ED in Sudan. A member of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, Sudan (OHCHR) also participated as they have been actively involved and supportive of the Sudanese CSOs working on ED. Bringing together 7 Sudanese CSOs, along with OHCHR and ISS, signals a rare show of unified grassroots coordination. In a war-torn context with extreme fragmentation, this outcome helps: Create a unified voice on enforced disappearances.  Build a collective strategy for lobbying and advocacy.  Promote ownership and collaboration among local actors, avoiding externally imposed agendas. Participation from OHCHR and ISS boosted the campaign’s credibility and global visibility. Their involvement signals: International recognition of the issue. Potential linkages to broader human rights mechanisms, including UN reporting Fact Finding Mission (FFM), legal advocacy, and diplomatic pressure.  
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The number of enforced disappearances (ED) cases in Sudan has risen since fighting broke out on 15 April 2023 between the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces. Enforced disappearance has been a common practice in Sudan for decades and was employed by former President Omar al-Bashir’s state security apparatus to silence human rights defenders and opposition leaders. Both the Sudanese Armed Forces and the Rapid Support Forces are engaged in random and indiscriminate detention of civilians. In most cases, detainees are subjected to torture and other inhuman treatments, while others are being charged with unfounded offenses accounting for a death sentence. The tragedy has been heightened by the war environment in Sudan which has left many human rights defenders and organizations with little space to represent, document, or verify cases. Volker Türk, UN Human Rights chief, in a speech, told the Human Rights Council on 12 September 2023 that at least 500 people were reported to have disappeared in Khartoum alone since fighting broke out

**Contribution of the programme**: From the 8th - 10th June 2024 in Kampala Uganada, PAX organized a four-day L&A training and campaign development workshop. The objective was to bring key Sudanese grassroots CSOs & activists together to develop a coordinated L&A campaign strategy on ED that can be effectively and timely rolled out within the current context of the war in Sudan. With the ongoing war and limited access to victims by HRDs, advocacy, and campaigning have become critical in mobilizing coordinated efforts from Sudanese and international actors to demand action against Enforced Disappearances (ED) and other human rights abuses.

The facilitator collaborated with PAX staff to design a comprehensive training program. The objective was to unite grassroots Sudanese CSOs and activists to develop a coordinated L&A campaign strategy on ED in the context of the ongoing war in Sudan.  Strategic Guidance: A representative from the Institute for Security Studies (ISS) participated to provide insights on the best lobbying strategies targeting the African Union (AU). She serves as the ISS AU liaison based in Addis Ababa.  Campaign Development: Ashanhom (For Them) As a direct outcome of the workshop, a six-month campaign titled "Ashanhom" was launched.
