**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In 2022, in Kinshasa, the Congolese Ministry of Defense decided to send additional troops to better protect and control the border area between the DRC and the Central African Republic.
**Significance of the outcome**: This area has long been neglected by the Congolese security forces and the UN peacekeeping mission is also absent  there. However, armed groups and criminal gangs often cross the border, posing a serious threat to civilians in the area. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: A stronger presence from the Congolese army in the border area should play a deterrent effect and limit the number of illegal border crossings by armed groups and criminal gangs. A stronger control of the border is generally supported by the local Congolese communities, local authorities and also by the Mbororo leaders, who fear attacks by Central African groups crossing into the DRC.
**Rating significance**: medium

**Contribution of the programme**: PAX and APRu conducted advocacy on this issue in Kinshasa and in the border area, urging the Congolese government and army to strengthen control and security at the DRC-CAR border.

PAX developed a map with the entry point of illegal armed groups into the DRC, which was used for both the strengthening of the civil resilience as well for border protection purposes.
