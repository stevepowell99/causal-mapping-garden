**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Following an advocacy campaign by ACAT, the Ministry of Justice in Burundi made a decision on 2 November 2022, and on 16 March 2023, to release 300 prisoners who had committed minor offences with the aim of reducing prison overcrowding.
**Significance of the outcome**: As a result of large scale arbitrary arrests including arrests of youth activists in 2015, and slow procedures in releasing acquitted persons, Burundian prisons are heavily overcrowded. The conditions in the prisons are dire with many prisoners experiencing violations of prisoners' rights in relation to health and food. This has left many prisoners victims of violence, torture and suffering necessitating need for reform.
