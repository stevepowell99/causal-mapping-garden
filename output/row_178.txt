**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On the 8th of October 2022 during the 51st session of the UN Human Rights Council (UNHRC) in Geneva, the mandate of the International Commission of Human Rights Experts on Ethiopia (ICHREE) was extended with a majority vote after various lobby efforts from CSOs. 
**Significance of the outcome**: This is a significant outcome because, there has been ongoing border tensions between Sudan and Ethiopia especially in Al Farshaga border region. A potential border war could destabilise not only the two countries but also the entire region. In addition, how the issue is handled and its outcome will have serious consequences for political transitions in both countries. In June 2022, the Sudanese Army accused their Ethiopian counterparts of executing seven captured Sudanese soldiers and one civilian and publicly displaying their bodies. The incident sparked the withdrawal of the Sudanese ambassador to Ethiopia. Ethiopia continuesly accused Sudan of supporting TPLF, an allegation Khartoum denies. Above all, Sudan is hosting thousands of Ethiopian refugees because of the conflict in Ethiopia. These geo-politics tensions between Egypt, Ethiopia and Sudan that includes the GERD project, risks undermining the stability of the entire region of the Horn of Africa leading to mass atrocities. While all this was happening, evidence has been uncovered that the Sudan Armed Forces (SAF) led by Buhran the leader of the coup military government wing, has been aiding the TPLF to forcefully recruit Ethiopian refugee men to fight againist the Ethiopian army. Therefore the opportunity to extend the ICHREE, is crucial because it gives opportunity for formal investigations to be conducted against the Sudan military who continue to abuse their power and commit gross human rights violation on civilians with impunity. This connects, with So2 objective of making sure that justice is preserved especially againist state security actors.
