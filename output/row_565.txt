**FragmentID**: SCC-PAL2508/ESF012
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Dutch society (individuals, groups) and media have been mobilizing attention for the topic of financial institutions' involvement with the illegal settlement enterprise (and calling on financial institutions to act) following the publication of the DBIO report. For example: our campaign posts are widely shared on social media and people tag their own financial institutions with a request for information or a call to action; groups of individuals have created their own websites (e.g. nietinmijnnaam, stopfundinggenocide) based on the DBIO report which offer the opportunity to send a complaint letter to your financial institutions; groups of pension fund participants (e.g. medical personnel, civil servants) have written open letters to their pension fund with calls to actions, based on the DBIO report and shared this on social media; employees of financial institutions have been asking questions internally about their employers' investment policies with regards to Israel and the OPT. 
**Significance of the outcome**: 1) in the first years of the project, pressure on financial institutions was mainly done by the members of the DBIO coalition (as well as other ngo's). In 2024 and 2025, many people informed us that following the publication of the DBIO report they reached out to their bank, pension fund or insurer to call for action, either independently or through the Fair Finance Guide complaints mechanism and multiple individuals/groups have started their own campaign initiatives based on the data provided in the DBIO report.
