**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In November 2023, the Minister of Justice and Keeper of the Seals, implemented corrective measures to reduce torture in the prisons in Burundi following evidence generated by monitors of ACAT on ill-treatment and torture inflicted on the prisoners by chief prison mates and prison wardens. 
**Significance of the outcome**: For a long time, there were cases of torture and ill-treatment recorded by ACAT-Burundi in Burundi's prisons with an average of 10 to 15 cases per month. This included failure to secure treatment by prisoners who had been tortured in prisons for example the case of Clement Nkurunziza in Ngozi prison. So ACAT engaged in the fight against torture and ill treatment of prisoners, using multiple mechanisms like enagement of the national human rights institution (CNIDH), social media and engagement of diplomatic missions.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In 2023, the use of social networks and the media was essential in denouncing violations of prisoners' rights such as access to health care and food for prisoners in distress in urgent actions. Informal contacts were made with the prison administration and the Ministry of Justice to remedy the situation, in some cases with success. For example the case of Clement Nkurunziza who was seriously ill and had been denied access to medical treatment outside the prison as recommended by the doctor. Following the advocacy by ACAT on social media, he was allowed to go for treatment in Bujumbura one day later.
