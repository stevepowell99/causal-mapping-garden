**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: PAX's support in Burkina Faso since 2021 has provided a platform for civil society actors in Burkina Faso who are working effectively in synergy to promote respect for the rights of people detained for acts of terrorism and their access to justice.
**Significance of the outcome**: The validation of the report on monitoring human rights in prisons marked a major starting point for future collaboration between CIFDHA and six (06) actors working on human rights issues in Burkina Faso. To ensure the success of the advocacy work, CIFDHA set up a CSO platform of seven human rights organisations, which conducted the advocacy campaign between May and October 2022 in synergy. This makes it possible to pool efforts, skills and resources to achieve a common goal. It makes the campaign stronger and more effective.
