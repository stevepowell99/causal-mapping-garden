**Significance of the outcome**: Since 2023, there has been an increase in attacks on HRDs, including arbitrary arrests, detention, enforced disappearance, intimidation, and surveillance. Journalists such as Genet Asimamaw, Gobeze Sisay, Dawit Begashaw, and others were arrested and detained for allegedly committing crimes relating to supporting terrorism, misinformation, and disinformation. Other Artist HRDs were also arrested and detained for alleged suspicion of inciting violence. Similar attacks and threats were faced by other HRDs and HRD organisations. This civic space situation was deteriorating and needed to be addressed. This situation was brought to the attention of the ACHPR through a side event and a summary report submitted by the EHRDC.
