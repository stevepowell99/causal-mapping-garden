**Significance of the outcome**: Most of the survivors have a fear of visiting Mosul, and that is a great challenge for them because of the cruelty, injustice, aggression, and rape they saw by the organization inside Mosul, where everything in Mosul reminds them of that dark period, according to what one of the survivors said, even the smell of cooking and clothes, and that their entry into Mosul had a great psychological impact.  This was a great challenge for them, but they broke the barrier of fear.
