**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: The Burkina Faso authorities are committed to strengthening the protection of human rights and the fight against impunity for the defence and security forces, thanks to the advocacy work carried out by civil society. To this end, on 16 February 2023, the Transitional Legislative Assembly (TLA) adopted a law amending the code of military justice to take account of the judicial nature of domestic counter-terrorism operations and to improve the management and documentation of offences committed during operations. 
**Significance of the outcome**: As part of the fight against terrorism, the Defence and Security Forces (FDS) and their auxiliaries (the Volunteers for the Defence of the Homeland -VDP) are regularly the subject of allegations of human rights violations, in particular summary and extrajudicial executions, cases of torture, arbitrary arrests and detentions, and enforced disappearances.   The adoption of the law by the TLA marks the will of the State of Burkina Faso to prevent all human rights violations during operations by the defence and security forces against terrorism, but also to gather evidence of any violations so that the perpetrators can be held to account. This represents a step forward in terms of respect for human rights in the fight against terrorism and the fight against impunity for the perpetrators of abuses and violations committed in this context.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In view of the reports and allegations of human rights violations, it seemed important to revise the code of military justice to introduce provost marshals even if a state of war has not been declared. This will make it possible to document offences committed during operations and thus allow the presence of judicial police officers in military groups and detachments present in conflict zones (judicialisation of theatres of operations), to protect military personnel operating in the field and also to protect civilians. On 16 December 2022, the Burkina Faso government adopted a draft bill in the Council of Ministers to create provost marshals in theatres of operation. The provost marshals are intended to solve the problem of the lack of investigation and judicial handling of allegations of human rights violations and abuses committed by the SDF and terrorist groups. They also make it possible to have sufficient evidence to clear a person of alleged offences, or rather to charge him or her on the basis of this evidence. This would make it possible to try detainees for terrorist offences fairly quickly, and to combat long waiting times and prison overcrowding. It remains important to continue monitoring human rights in conflict zones to better assess the application and effects of the new law on the ground.

**Contribution of the programme**: In December 2021, CIFDHA and PAX monitored the human rights situation at the PHS. This monitoring work, the report of which was validated by 06 CSOs (Amnesty Burkina, MBDHP, CQDJ, SOS Pénitentier, CISC, TARTITT), made it possible to highlight the problems of prison overcrowding that were underway in this prison, and the long periods of detention of alleged terrorists that detainees were experiencing due to the lack of evidence to judge the detainees. The report was produced and circulated to the relevant authorities. CIFDHA and PAX set up an advocacy platform on the report's recommendations in February 2022. The members of the advocacy platform were involved in drafting an advocacy document from 12 to 14 May 2022 in Koudougou. An advocacy campaign on preventing radicalisation in prisons and improving access to justice for people detained as part of the fight against terrorism in Burkina Faso was carried out from May to December 2022. During this campaign, the members of the advocacy platform were able to meet several authorities, including the SP CSM on 15 July 2022, the Secretary General, currently the Minister of Justice, on 14 September 2022, the Director General of the Penitentiary Administration in November 2022, and the Director General of the Legal Aid Fund on 19 July 2022. Subsequently, on 06 February 2023, CIFDHA was heard by the Foreign Affairs, Defence and Security Committee of the Transitional Legislative Assembly on the draft law on provosts' offices. During the hearing, CIFDHA congratulated the initiative and encouraged the MPs to adopt the bill. CIDFHA officially handed over the document it had produced in collaboration with PAX for this purpose. At its session on 16 February 2023, the Transitional Legislative Assembly adopted the law amending the code of military justice to establish provost marshals in the internal operations of the FAN. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The monitoring report was validated by 06 CSOs: Amnesty Burkina, MBDHP, CQDJ, SOS Pénitentier, CISC, TARTITT.  The above-mentioned CSOs participated in the drafting of the advocacy document and in the advocacy meetings.  Amnesty Burkina was invited at the same time to hearings with the commission in charge of examining the draft law before the final adoption of the law by the Transitional Assembly.
