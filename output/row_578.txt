**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Between May and July 2025, UNHCR MENA began implementing key components of returns programming in Syria, including launching an online FAQ platform, issuing calls for local partner support, and initiating data collection on HLP and livelihoods.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before this outcome, UNHCR had consistently pushed back against key recommendations from Refugee Protection Watch (RPW), citing lack of capacity and showing little movement on returns programming, despite sustained advocacy efforts since RPW's inception. INGOs operating in Syria also lacked the local knowledge needed to adapt to the political transition in December 2024, limiting their ability to respond effectively. This shift is significant because it reflects a tangible change in UNHCR’s approach, aligning with RPW’s long-term advocacy goals to center refugee voices, local expertise, and transparent information-sharing in return processes. It also marks a breakthrough moment where the coalition’s persistence, combined with contextual shifts, enabled meaningful influence on international actors’ behavior.
