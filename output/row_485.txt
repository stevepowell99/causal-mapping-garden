**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: Marc Manirakiza, a businessman and CNDDD-FDD activist, abandoned his plan to carry out a probable extrajudicial execution of journalist Sandra Muhoza on April 17, 2024. 
**Significance of the outcome**: On April 13, 2024, in Ngozi, journalist Sandra Muhoza received a call from Marc Manirakiza, alias Pocheni, an influential businessman close to the government. He intended to offer her an interview on avocado farming. Despite her misgivings, Sandra accepted. She disappeared shortly after. It was only during the night that a message, sent from her phone, informed her husband that she would not be returning. The family immediately launched a search, questioning Pocheni and the security services, without success. The next day, a message indicated that she was being held at the headquarters of the National Intelligence Service (SNR) in Bujumbura. No authority officially confirmed her detention or the reasons for her arrest. Rumors suggested a connection to the dissemination of information about a suspicious importation of machetes. Her worried family feared mistreatment or forced confessions. Sandra became the second female journalist imprisoned in Burundi, after Floriane Irangabiye.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Marc called Sandra Muhoza by phone under the pretext of an interview on his project of planting avocadoes in Ngozi. While there, Sandra narrowly escaped extrajudicial execution. The rescue of Sandra Muhoza, thanks to a rapid citizen alert, highlighted the vulnerability of critical voices, but also the responsiveness of certain non-state actors. This act prevented irreparable harm in a context of widespread impunity. However, in the absence of judicial follow-up or institutional guarantees of non-repetition, this effect remains a one-off. It nevertheless constitutes a symbolically powerful precedent in the fight against serious human rights violations.
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: Non-state authorities
**Scale**: Individual
**Contribution of the programme**: FOCODE  issued alerts about her dissappearance and mobilised citizen action for the safety of Sandra. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Other  actors contributed to achieving the effect. Several civil society organizations (CSOs) and independent media outlets relayed alerts and messages regarding Sandra Muhoza's disappearance, thereby increasing public pressure on the authorities. Their contribution consisted of widely disseminating the information, maintaining national and international public awareness, and calling for respect for the journalist's rights. These relays helped prevent the case from being covered up, thus reinforcing the effectiveness of the initial alert issued by FOCODE.
