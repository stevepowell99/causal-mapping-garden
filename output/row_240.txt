**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Start of the 2023-2024 school year in Burkina Faso Ouédraogo Bonyamini (aged 19) from sector 6 in the Bangrin district of Ouahigouya/Yatenga province/Northern region of Burkina Faso went back to school after dropping out for two years, thanks to the intervention of heroine Ouédraogo Mariam. He is currently enrolled in the welding course at the Zoodo school complex. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The security situation in the north of Burkina Faso is difficult. Street children and children who have dropped out of school are targets for recruitment by armed terrorist groups. Ouédraogo Bonyamini (19) did not go to school for two years because he fell ill. After that, he didn't want to go to school any more because his classmates were in higher classes. His parents couldn't convince him because the child wanted to continue in technical education, but the parents didn't know; so there's a lack of communication between parents and children. This is very common in the northern region. This is an important effect because it is in line with our general objective, which is to prevent radicalisation and violent extremism through the actions of women and men leaders in the northern region
