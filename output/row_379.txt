**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In November 2023, several project-funded CBOs in Bashiqa led by Yazidi women and other young members of minority groups collaborated and launched a large initiative aimed at addressing the institutional marginalization of Shabak villages.
**Significance of the outcome**: Since the invasion by ISIS, Ninewa has experienced heightened sectarian tensions, particularly between the Muslim and Yazidi communities. These tensions have been notably acute between the Yazidis and Sunni Shabaks, with the relationship between Bashiqa town and neighboring Shabak villages particularly affected by these tensions. At the start of the project, CBOs (typically composed of one societal component) were resistant to the project's inclusive approach and were less inclined to include members of other communities in their activities. That was especially the case with Yazidi volunteers. After taking part of trainings and coaching efforts by PFO, and following their implementation of several project initiatives, a community peace team, spearheaded by a young Yazidi woman, has dedicated its efforts to advocating for the rights of the Shabak community. Volunteer groups and civil society activists throughout Iraq are increasingly committed to fostering a holistic approach that prioritizes human rights, women's rights, freedom of religion and belief, and the promotion of peaceful coexistence. The project is therefore taking part of this trend.
