**FragmentID**: SCC-DRC2305/CIV002
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: On November 13, 2021, in Kinshasa and other cities in the DRC, tens of thousands of Congolese, including many Christians as well as political leaders, peacefully marched and filed a memorandum to demand a truly independent and non-politicized National Electoral Commission.
**Significance of the outcome**: This was probably the largest popular mobilization so far on the electoral process under President Felix Tshisekedi. Prior to this, street mobilization on these issues remained low. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The government felt the pressure of this popular march, which prompted it to engage in more dialogue on these issues with religious leaders from the Church of Christ in Congo (ECC) and the Catholic Church. The march showed also that Catholics and Protestants were joining hands in this struggle for free and fair elections.
