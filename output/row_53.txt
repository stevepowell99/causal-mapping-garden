**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: As a result of participating in psychosocial support sessions (under a violence prevention parenting Program "Program ABB") implemented in the Bint jbeil ABAAD center in the last quarter of 2022 as part of the SCC Programme, couples experienced positive changes in their lives. One participant shared his story of how he started supporting his wife in house chores, leading to better communication (an indirect pathway to preventing relationship violence). Another participant, a community leader in Bint Jbeil, started spending more quality time with his children, resulting in increased happiness among the children and improved communication and expressions of love between the participant and his wife. Program ABB contributed to strengthening couples' relationships and improving family dynamics.
**Significance of the outcome**: In a community where cultural and societal norms that discourage men from showing vulnerability are rooted, men fear of expressing their emotions. The program helped promote gender equality and challenge traditional gender roles. When men share household responsibilities, it can help reduce the burden on women and promote a more equitable distribution of work and responsibilities within the household. The program had significant positive impacts on couples' relationships, gender equality, and child well-being. When community leaders model healthy relationship behaviors and emotional expression, it can help promote positive attitudes towards these behaviors within the community. These outcomes highlight the importance of investing in programs that promote healthy relationships and positive family dynamics, as they can have wide-ranging benefits for individuals, families, and communities.
