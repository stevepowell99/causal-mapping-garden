**Outcome description**: In September 2024, UN Special Rapporteur on the Right to Food referenced environmental issues (and PAX’s contribution) in his new thematic report on starvation, which he later presented at UNGA session in October 2024.
**Significance of the outcome**: SR's new report on the right to food , with an emphasis on Palestine, included references to the negative impacts of conflict-linked environmental destruction on food security, specifically mentioning environmental pollution, destruction of agro-food facilities and water resources in various conflict contexts, including Palestine, Ukraine, Syria and Lebanon, thus reaffirming the linkage between environmental aspects of conflicts (EPS issues) and food security. This is significant, as such recognition helps to break siloes between different agenda and  to mainstream EPS concerns across a variety of policy processes.
