**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In December 2023, the Governor of the Province of North Kivu instructed the administrators of the territories of Masisi and Nyiragongo, in his letter No 01/1932/CAB/GP-NK/2023 of 21 December 2023, to question the leaders of the Wazalendo groups in order to call on them to respect human rights by putting an end to the Kiboro underground dungeons, spoke about this at the security meeting held on 30 January in Monigi, and put an army captain in charge of the file on the elimination of these dungeons, which led to the closure of the Mujoga dungeon in the Kibati groupement.
**Significance of the outcome**: This effect is significant in that it reflects the provincial authority's recognition of its responsibility to protect human rights. This is an evolution, as it was rare for the authorities to give clear written instructions to subordinates regarding human rights violations, fearing a kind of self-accusation instead of only verbal instructions during meetings which was done sometimes previously.
