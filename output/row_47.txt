**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In 2022, female community members participated for the first time alongside men in civil society activities in the Nimrud district of Ninewa
**Significance of the outcome**: Previously, it was rare for women in Nimrud to attend any activity that included men, because the district is characterized by tribal norms that reject mixing or the inclusion of women in civic life. Women in the Nimrud district are heavily marginalized on the basis of their identity and there is a high occurence of SGBV cases amongst the community. The participation of women in civil society activties in Nimrud grants them a space to recognize their experience and influence decision-making actors to take their priorities into consideration.
