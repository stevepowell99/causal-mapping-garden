**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Parliamentary questions about  accountability on use of EWIPA in Yemen, as well as the political declaration,  were asked in December 2022, and answered in January 2023. This is the first time after the Netherlands signed the political declaration that they spoke about EWIPA. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Discussing the issue of explosive weapons in populated areas specifically framed as such in Parliament contributed to putting and keeping the issue on the national political agenda. As this was the first time after the Nls signed the political declaration, it sends a signal that parliament wants the Nls to implement the declaration after a period where most attention was given to the Netherlands signing the declaration.
