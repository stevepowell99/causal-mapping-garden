**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Between October and December 2023, during a series of panels organised in Masisi-centre, Rubaya, Sake, Bweremana, Shasha, Rusayo, Kibati and Monigi, local authorities and associations (i.e. Commanders of the Forces Armées de la République Démocratique du Congo(FARDC), local heads of the national intelligence service (ANR), commanders of the sub-commissariats of the Police Nationale Congolaise(PNC), village chiefs, and the Governor's Deputy) signed  commitments to protect human rights issues covering the fight against torture, arbitrary arrests, extortion at roadblocks, early and forced marriages and abuses committed by the Wazalendo. The commitments were signed between the authorities, associations and a ASSODIP agent during panels organised by ASSODIP.   
**Significance of the outcome**: The importance of this effect stems from the fact that, before, the state actors expressed reservations about a written commitment. These signed documents will enable ASSODIP to come back to them to ask for the level of execution of these commitments, in fact to hold them to account.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: It should be noted that these commitments also concern the protection of women's rights focusing on fighting against forced marriages and gender based violence.
