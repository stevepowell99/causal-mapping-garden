**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2305/PHR023
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: The situation in prisons and the level of respect for the human rights of suspected terrorists held in the High Security Prison (PHS) is better known, and the authorities have undertaken to improve the conditions likely to exacerbate radicalisation in prisons thanks to the monitoring work carried out by CIFDHA and PAX.
**Significance of the outcome**: More than 1,000 people are being held at the PHS, most of them suspected terrorists. They have been held there for at least 7 years and are still awaiting trial. Unfortunately, given the sensitivity of the subject and the work being done to defend human rights in this period of the fight against terrorism, no official documentation of the prison situation of PHS detainees had been carried out. It was important to document and assess the level of respect for human rights in this prison establishment. After sharing the report with the Ministry of Justice, the Minister of Justice visited the PHS to assess the situation and indicated the government's determination to improve prison conditions.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The monitoring work highlighted cases of violations of prisoners' rights within the High Security Prison (PHS) and made recommendations to the government and other stakeholders. The monitoring report revealed violations of the human dignity of detainees due to prison overcrowding: built to accommodate 448 detainees at the outset, the PHS had 1,003 detainees in October, i.e. prison overcrowding of +223.88%; failure to comply with time limits for police custody; difficulties in accessing healthcare; very long delays while awaiting trial; violation of the right to food. There is also a lack of separation of detainees by category within the PHS. Given this situation, the prison environment is in danger of becoming a breeding ground for radicalisation. 
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: 10 CIFDHA monitors were trained by PAX in human rights monitoring in prisons. The monitors then designed a framework and collected data, which was analysed on the basis of the law. The monitoring report was analysed and written with the technical support of PAX's Sahel Project Lead. The report was then validated by Burkina Faso CSOs, including MBDHP, CQDJ, SOS Pénitentier, CISC and TARTITT. Once validated, the report was shared with the Ministry of Justice, the prison administration, the examining magistrate of the specialised anti-terrorist unit and the High Council of the Judiciary. An oral statement on the situation was also made by the CIFDHA at the 69th session of the ACHPR in November 2021.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The associations TARTITT, Mouvement Burkinabè des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples (MBDHP), SOS Pénitentier and Collectif contre l'impunité et la stigmatisation des communautés (CISC) contributed to the monitoring work by providing interpreters in the Fulfulde and Tamachek languages, providing updated data and participating in the validation of the report.
