**FragmentID**: SCC-INT2508/ESF011
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In 2024/5, states discussed concrete cases of arms tranfers during three official Arms Trade Treaty meeting sessions in Geneva, which was for the first time in ten years ATT, and after many years of pressure from Control Arms, incl. PAX. 
**Significance of the outcome**: In part as result from advocacy by Control Arms (incl. PAX as long-term key member) the 2023 Conference of States Parties had decided to include a new agenda item opening space for discussing emerging issues. In 2024 and 2025 this resulted in three sessions where this indeed took place, covering topics of arms transfers to for example, Israel, Sudan and Myanmar. This led to intense debate, incl. pushback by some states, but mostly support from others. This is significant as finally the ATT appears to be ready to discuss real world arms trade cases rather than sessions only dealing with on how implemantation of the treaty could look like.
