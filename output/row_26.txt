**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2305/PHR027
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: Since 2021, CIFDHA has been working in synergy with the Mouvement Burkinabè des Droits de l'Homme et des Peuples (MBDHP) to monitor the human rights situation in the North, Centre-North and Sahel regions.
**Significance of the outcome**: Previously, MBDHP and CIFDHA monitored human rights violations and abuses in isolation. This limited the effectiveness of the monitoring and the advocacy work that could result. Synergy of action enables the organisations to share their experience and expertise in terms of monitoring. This guarantees a safe and effective monitoring system. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In view of the insecurity, it has proved very important to have a good network of credible monitors capable of carrying out the work. The MBDHP is one of the major associations present throughout the country. The collaboration between MBDHP and CIFDHA is a great initiative to achieve wide geographical coverage and access to information on the ground in an efficient and professional manner.
