**FragmentID**: SCC-LEB2508/PHR017
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: On 27 May 2024, EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs Joesph Borrell, and representatives from Belgium, Germany, France, the Netherlands and the United States reiterated their position that Syria remains unsafe for return and/or that forced deportations Syrian refugees must stop during the opening remarks  at the Ministerial session of the 8th Brussels Conference on ‘Supporting the future of Syria and the region’. 
**Significance of the outcome**: In the months leading up to the Ministerial Meeting of the 8th Brussels Conference on the Future of Syria, Cyprus, together with the Government of Lebanon, has advocated for an EU-Lebanon migration deal under which the EU would reportedly 1) Provide additional financial support to Lebanese security agencies to prevent people from trying to reach Cyprus’ shores; and/or 2) Declare parts of) Syria as safe to return to and/or 3) Expand return assistance programming to “safe areas” inside Syria in order to incentivize refugee returns. Since, several EU member states have ramped up pressure  on the European Commission to revise key parts of its long-stated policy on Syrian refugees and conditions for safe, voluntary and dignified return to Syria. As RPW one of the main advocacy objectives is for the EU and EU member states to take actions to protect the principle of non-refoulement and pressure the Lebanese authorities to increase the protection space for Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Having the EU's High Representative for Foreign Affairs and individual EU member states adopt language  that aligns with the various evidence-based reports concluding that Syria remains unsafe during a setting with other member states present was therefore significant in reiterating the importance of upholding the line.

The key message in opportunities to influence was a clear red line on changing the status of Syria to being a safe country given the manyfold reports by the UN and others underlining the instability and insecurity across Syria. Moreover, RPW added to the other voices pushing for a counter narrative and nuance on the returns discousre on Syria.
