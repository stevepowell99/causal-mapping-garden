**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Following the contribution of the monitors (TRIJEUD and ADD) in documenting cases of human rights violations between August and November 2022, a database giving a clear, detailed overview with evidence is available for the production of a quality report.  
**Significance of the outcome**: The database of well-documented cases facilitates the identification of patterns of human rights violations in the region. A quality, evidence-based report can then be produced that facilitates the development of an advocacy strategy based on a more realistic overview of the cases, which is important because the data collection was carried out in the tri-border area, where human rights violations and abuses are on the increase.
