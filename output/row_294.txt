**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In September 2023, Dutch financial institutions joined a closed-doors roundtable meeting organized and facilitated by PAX at the PAX office to discuss with each other investments in occupied territories
**Significance of the outcome**: It has proven quite difficult over the years to engage in (even private) conversations with financial institutions on investments in the OPT. Due to the political sensitivity and anticipated public backlash financial institutions are very hesitant to speak out. The fact that they now participated in this closed-doors roundtable meeting, shared about their own choices, concerns and due diligence policies and practices with us and with each other was a significant step in opening the conversation and keeping it open.
