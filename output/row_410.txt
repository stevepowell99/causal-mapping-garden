**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: During the United Nations Human Rights Council session held in October 2023, in Geneva, the Government of Burundi supported / agreed to the recommendations made in the CSOs' alternative report on cooperation with the UN human rights protection mechanisms.
**Significance of the outcome**: Following the outbreak of the crisis in 2015, the government of Burundi ceased cooperation with different human rights mechanisms. For example, the government denied entry of the Commission of Inquiry and the Special Rapporteur on the situation of human rights in Burundi. During the previous UPR in 2018, the state of Burundi simply noted the recommendation '137.62'. During the most recent UPR in 2023, similar recommendations were given by Georgia, Sierra Leone, Ethiopia, Cameroon, and Switzerland, which were all supported (recommendations 145.29 to 145.33). This is a significant step towards achieving the specific objective 1 'The Burundian authorities respond to calls for adherence to international/regional human rights standards and initiatives related to freedom of expression, assembly and association, and the protection of (W)HRDs', as it signifies the state of Burundi's willingness to cooperate with the mechanisms for the protection of human rights, which was not the case five years ago.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: On 4th April 2023, representatives from ACAT_Burundi, CBDDH and FORSC participated in the the pre-session of the UN-UPR on Burundi 2023 and issued oral statements on the situation of Human Rights in Burundi. Marie Salphati, FIACAT representative to the UN, appreciated FORSC's presentation and connected the organisation to 8 diplomats from the USA, Costa Rica, Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Luxembourg, Finland, Belgium, France, and Switzerland, with whom they held advocacy meetings, alongside the representatives from ACAT-Burundi and CBDDH. The diplomats commented that the matter related to ESCR (Economic, Social and Cultural Rights) is becoming increasingly extensive and is of interest to their partners [who are the diplomats' partners?]. The 3 HRDs lobbied the country representatives to make strong recommendations to the State of Burundi during the UPR session held in May 2023 to cooperate fully with human rights mechanisms. At the 54th ordinary session of the United Nations Human Rights Council held from 11th September to 13th October 2023, the Burundian government supported all the recommendations related to cooperation with the human rights mechanisms.  The UNHRC stated that it was satisfied with the recommendations in the alternative report, which had been accepted by the Government of Burundi, including continued cooperation with the United Nations mechanisms and other international mechanisms.[is this an alternative OutcomeStatement? if not, there seems to be a bit of duplication in all these phrases].
