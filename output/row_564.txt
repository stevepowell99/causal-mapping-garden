**FragmentID**: SCC-PAL2508/ESF013
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: European financial institutions (publicly or silently) took action (in the form of engagement and/or divestment) towards companies involved with the illegal settlements in the OPT  between January 2024 and now. For example: Norwegian pension fund KLP publicly divested from US construction company Caterpillar, because of this company's involvement with violations of international law in the OPT. in their exclusion decision they refer to the DBIO report. 
**Significance of the outcome**: 1) many European financial institutions invest in companies that contribute to the construction, maintenance and expansion of the illegal Israeli settlements in the Occupied Palestinian Territories. These companies thereby facilitate severe and systematic violations of international law and human rights. Financial institutions that invest in these companies hold key leverage as well as responsibility to use that leverage, to make sure they don't (keep) contribute/ing to these violations.  2) The objective of the DBIO project is to make FIs end their involvement with the illegal settlement enterprise in the OPT. They can do this through engagement with their clients and investee companies that contribute to the settlements and/or (ultimately) through divestment from these companies. Ideally, the FIs publicly communicate about and motivate these divestment decisions, as this can put extra reputational pressure on the involved company (also in the eyes of other investors and stakeholders). So this outcome is directly translatable to the objective of the project.
