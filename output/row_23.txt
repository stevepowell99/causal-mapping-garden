**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2305/PHR001
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: Since July 2021, after completing the third module of the AINL online training on MDR, the monitors of RCP in Burundi have been producing credible and verifiable reports on human rights violations, in accordance with MDR standards (such as sufficient evidence and details to verify the events and classify them as violations).
**Significance of the outcome**: Before the training, monitors were not following the principles and standards of MDR while reporting human rights issues and as a result their reports were capturing security incidents/issues. The MDR training increased the capacity of monitors on human rights violations reporting standards. The reports produced by the monitors are a source of evidence to hold Burundian authorities accountable for grave human rights violations by the International human rights community.
