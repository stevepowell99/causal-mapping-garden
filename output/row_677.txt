**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Ethiopia
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Throughout 2025, two HRDs trained by Amnesty International have integrated their newly gained knowledge and skills in their trainings to others in areas such as gender-based violence (GBV) and GBV case management; digital security and safety, including online GBV.
**Significance of the outcome**: The initial aim of the training provided to Ehtiopian HRDs by Amnesty International was to ensure safe and secure monitoring, documentation and reporting of human rights violations/abuses in conflict areas in Ethiopia. The fact that HRDs use elements from the training within their own training and coaching activities to others is a welcoming development, but not necessarily foreseen. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: One HRD has used elements from the training in training other stakeholders, including survivors of GBV, on GBV management. This was in the context of a project sponsored by Center of Concern (NGO). Another HRD delivered a digital security and safety session for 6 members of Gorzoâ€™s executive team and later conducted a training for 13 young female activists under a FempeaceEA project, covering digital security, online gender-based violence (OGBV), and gendered disinformation.

**StoryFragment_Merged**: Outcome description:  One HRD who participated in the Amnesty International training in October 2024, applied the training directly when working with Amnesty International to document the brutal U.S. airstrike in Yemen that killed and injured Ethiopian detainees. I interviewed 15 survivors (13 Tigrigna speakers, 2 Amharic speakers), applying trauma-sensitive and ethical interviewing skills, following safeguarding policies, and ensuring the sessions were conducted with empathy and without retraumatization. I then carefully transcribed and translated the interviews into English, adding contextual notes to clarify cultural elements and observations for staff.
