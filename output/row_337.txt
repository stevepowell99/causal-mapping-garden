**FragmentID**: SCC-INT2312/ESF004
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: The updated OECD Guidelines for MNE, published in June 2023, now include a reference to the expectation on companies to conduct enhanced HRDD in conflict-affected areas and to respect IHL
**Significance of the outcome**: The OECD Guidelines for Multinational Enterprises on Responsible Business Conduct form, together with the UN Guiding Principles on Business & Human Rights, the international authoritative norms on responsible business conduct. The UN Guiding Principles already included references to HRDD in conflict-affected areas and to IHL, but the OECD Guidelines (which tend to be referenced more often by corporate actors and in the context of due diligence legislation) not yet. Now they do. This gives actors that are advocating for explicit (legislative/practical) attention for the heightened risks and corresponding responsibilities for companies operating in conflict-affected settings (e.g. PAX) more leverage. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: 
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: International community
**Scale**: International
**Contribution of the programme**: PAX as well as other actors active in the field of business and human rights in conflict-affected settings have for years been advocating for the need to conduct heigthened HRDD in conflict-affected areas towards individual companies, investors and policy-makers. We also raised the need for the OECD Guidelines to follow the UNGPs and explicitly acknowledge this responsibility during public consultations that provided input for the 2023 update of the Guidelines. The change is intentional and positive.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, especially following the publication of the July 2021 report of the UN Working Group on Business & Human Rights (to which PAX also provided input) there has been increased attention for the concept and practice of heightened HRDD in conflict-affected areas. The 2023 update of the OECD Guidelines probably also reflects this.
