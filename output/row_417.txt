**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2312/PHR005
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In Mali, in December 2023, the transitional authorities responded favourably to pressure from human rights organisations, authorising the "16 Days of Activism" campaigns to raise awareness of and combat gender-based violence (GBV)
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to this, the Malian authorities had suspended the celebration of the 16 days of activism during 2022, signalling a restriction on initiatives linked to raising awareness and combating gender-based violence (GBV). The authorisation of the celebration of the Days of Activism campaigns in December 2023 is important for the objectives of the SCC programme, as one of the objectives of the programme is to combat GBV, and this marks a return to active involvement in raising awareness and preventing GBV.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: This development is also important for the SCC programme's partners, as it demonstrates their ability to positively influence government policies. It also demonstrates the relevance of collaborative approaches between human rights organisations and the authorities in promoting positive change in society.
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: TRIJEUD-Mali, because of the influence resulting from its human rights monitoring activities, was asked by other human rights organisations to draft and co-sign a press release calling for the adoption of a law to combat gender-based violence in Mali. This advocacy exerted pressure on the transitional authorities, indirectly influencing their decision to authorise the "16 Days of Activism" in December 2023.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The press release co-signed by TRIJEUD-Mali in August 2023 was drawn up jointly with the Association Noyaux Dur (AND) and Avocat Sans Frontière Canada (ASFC). These partner organisations have contributed by working closely together to strengthen advocacy in favour of activities to combat GBV.
