**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: On 19th January 2024, the new head of Military operation and the chiefs in Mukaya Payam, Lainya County Central Equatoria State, South Sudan, agreed to allow free movement of civilians between Yei and Mukaya.
**Significance of the outcome**: Communities of Mukaya have access to their homes. This has encouraged individuals from the internally displaced camps in Yei and the refugees in Uganda to voluntary return to Mukaya Payam, Lainya county. Before the change, Communities of Mukaya were staying within their own and were not able to visit each for years because of suspicions and counter accusations as supporters of different armed groups in the area during the active conflict. These activities have initiated the community leaders to speak openly in a neutral space. After, they jointly engaged with the military leaders in the region who than could guarantee safety on the roads.

**Contribution of the programme**: RECONCILE conducted two conflict transformation and peace building trainings between September and October 2023 for 89 participants selected from the two internally displaced camps in Yei (Atende and Jezira). these training brought together different communities from different camps. As a result they found that their mistrust was not grounded. This caused for more trust. Also Reconcile conducted one community dialogue in Gimunu Boma, Yei Town Payam, Yei River County from 8th -10th November 2023. This was a neutral place for the two camps. These activities have initiated the community leaders to speak openly in a neutral space. After, they jointly engaged with the military leaders in the region who then could guarantee safety on the roads.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: This was a process that involved other actors from 2021 and the final dialogue (Community Progresss organisation (CEPO), the community leades were some of the actors involved).
