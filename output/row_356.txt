**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In December 2023, the Governor of the Province of North Kivu asked election candidates working in the services of the Governorate of the Province to send him proof of their request to temporarily cease their role as civil servant until after the elections, in order to ensure respect for the principle of equality between election candidates. His request was done through a  circular, no. O1/1853/CAB/GP-NK/2023 dated December 4, 2023 addressed to political and administrative staff, as well as to managers and employees of other government departments attached to his office, who were standing as candidates in the elections.  
**Significance of the outcome**: Such positions were not so formal in the past, with the result that officials from the Governorate and related departments were competing with others without respecting the obligation of the Independent National Electoral Commission to ensure equality between candidates. Pressure on the authorities is leading them to enforce compliance with the principles, in this case that of equality between candidates.
