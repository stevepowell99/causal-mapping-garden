**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In 2022, in Kinshasa and Washington, D.C., the US publicly acknowledged and condemned Rwanda's support to the M23 rebel group and called for credible and timely elections in the DRC.
**Significance of the outcome**: Rwanda's support to the M23 has had a negative impact on the security and humanitarian situation in eastern DRC and on the electoral process. The US were the first  country to publicly denounce this support.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: It is important that the US insist on credible elections to reduce the risk of fraud and poorly organized elections, which would create tensions before, during and after the vote.

**Contribution of the programme**: CALCC and MILAPRO organized a high-profile sit-in in August 2022 in front of the US Embassy on the occasion of the visit of US Secretary of State Antony Blinken, with the participation also of leaders of the 'Social and political forces' movement. CALCC and MILAPRO handed out a memo and had high-level direct advocacy meetings with embassy staff before and after the sit-in. In the following months, the US government made public statements on these issues, in line with the demands of CALCC and MILAPRO.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes. An initial report by the UN Group of Experts on the DRC with evidence of Rwanda's support for the M23 also contributed to the US' position (but other Western states with access to the same information remained silent on the issue at the time).
