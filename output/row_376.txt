**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2508/CIV018
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Since 2023, after sending 112 victim files (Confidential) to the International Criminal Court, ICC investigators have already contacted 23 victims (Confidential) in Rwanda and Uganda. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Since the 2015 crisis in Burundi, victims have been denied access to justice. Since 2023, CAVIB has documented and prepared 112 victim files to submit to the International Criminal Court. In 2024 and 2025, the International Criminal Court was able to contact 23 victims for further investigation, clearly demonstrating that the International Criminal Court has begun its investigations. This clearly shows that the ICC is investigating these cases.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: For all these cases submitted to the International Criminal Court, the CAVIB had collected all the documentation in Uganda (Nakivale Camp) and in Rwanda (MAHAMA Camp)
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: International community
**Scale**: International 
**Contribution of the programme**: The program's interventions helped CAVIB achieve significant change, as it had a safe and confidential place to handle sensitive victim cases. CAVIB handled victims' cases to be submitted to various international jurisdictions with confidentiality, as it had an office suitable for handling cases with reassurance regarding listening and confidentiality between Cavib member lawyers and victims. Previously, this was done in cyberspace, Hotels or cafeterias where confidentiality was not an issue.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Other external actors contributed to this change because they came to us, in a confidential and safe place to hold strategic meetings or capacity building workshops together. Here I can mention the journalists who were members of civil society who came to collect sensitive information from cases submitted to international jurisdictions or for the case of Dr. Christophe Sahabo or even the victims who sent us legal evidences.
**Rating contribution**: moderate
