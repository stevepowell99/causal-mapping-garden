**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: To support the organisation of the voluntary return and safe stay of people in their places of origin, the High Commissioner of the province of Gourma adopted a participatory protocol defining the mechanisms and conditions for return, which came into force on 27 May 2025. Since 2023, local authorities in the province of Gourma have been organising the safe return to and secure retention of people in their localities of origin in Nagré, Tanwalbougou and Yamba (eastern region of Burkina Faso).
**Significance of the outcome**: The localities of Nagré, Tanwalbougou and Yamba are severely affected by the security crisis. In 2022, the village of Nagré was particularly hard hit by a terrorist attack that disrupted community life. Faced with this situation of high insecurity, nurses working at the health centre and several other people were forced to flee to Fada. Despite the passage of time, the ongoing security threat has prevented their return and the resumption of basic social services such as healthcare and drinking water supply. Ensuring the safety of the population and the functioning of basic social services are essential for a dignified and peaceful community life.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The populations at risk intended to leave the villages. The basic social services, which had become non-existent, did not encourage the return and retention of the population in their communities. Pregnant and breastfeeding women no longer had access to maternal health care. Added to this was the lack of security for both internally displaced persons who wished to return to their communities and those who remained in place. 
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: In November 2022, the project team conducted an in-depth diagnostic study on the state of socio-community infrastructure in the village of Nagré. In 2023, OCADES organised training in Fada on advocacy techniques and public policy monitoring for its members and community leaders, as well as members of local structures responsible for conflict prevention and management. Between 2022 and 2024, OCADES organised trust-building activities between the security forces and the population, which enabled dialogue between the actors. Thanks to these dialogue and consultation meetings, trust and collaboration have improved. In 2025, community actors carried out advocacy actions with the authorities, which led to the participatory development and validation of a protocol that now serves as a framework document for this purpose.
