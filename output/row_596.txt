**FragmentID**: SCC-LEB2508/PHR022
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: During 2025, the Dutch Ministry of Foreign Affairs in The Hague and the Dutch Embassy in Beirut significantly increased their engagement with Refugee Protection Watch (RPW), actively requesting input on key protection issues such as internal displacement in Lebanon, including Syrians, as a result of Israeli aggression, “go-and-see” visits to Syria, return support needs, post-return conditions in Syria, and perceptions of humanitarian aid in Lebanon. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The Dutch government—like many international actors—had limited access to reliable, real-time information about emerging or underserved refugee populations and/or displaced populations, such as Alawite Syrians displaced by coastal violence. These groups often fell outside established humanitarian monitoring systems and lacked visibility in donor assessments. This outcome is significant because it demonstrates that RPW is actively requested to provide input which reflects its importance and trusted role in filling critical information gaps with speed and accuracy, offering situational awareness, analysis and updated data where few others can. The ability to respond rapidly and independently—organically through the Signal group and without needing to be prompted—has increased RPW’s credibility and positioned it as an essential source of analysis for protection-focused decision-making. Additionally, this outcome is significant because it underscored the irreplaceable role of civil society in providing localized input.

**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: International community
**Scale**: National 
**Contribution of the programme**: RPW contributed by proactively collecting and sharing rapid analysis—such as during the May 2025 coastal displacement, when it independently conducted outreach and produced field data on the Alawite refugee population, a previously unmonitored and underserved group. RPW’s timely, self-initiated response and regular briefings with the Dutch Embassy in Beirut established its reputation for credible, localized information. Through sustained engagement, the network built trust that now results in direct requests for thematic analysis from both the Dutch Embassy and the MFA in The Hague.
