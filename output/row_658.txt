**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2508/PHR032
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In Burkina Faso, between 2023 and 2025, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and the Brigade of Volunteers for the Defence of the Fatherland organised awareness-raising sessions for all group leaders of the Volunteers for the Defence of the Fatherland (VDP) and trained human rights trainers to ensure that human rights are taken into account in VDP operations.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before 2023, the VDP were not sufficiently aware of the importance of respecting human rights in the context of their counter-terrorism operations, which exposed the civilian population to the risk of violations. Training VDP supervisors and raising awareness of human rights among their group leaders, who are in turn responsible for raising awareness among the VDPs they supervise, is an important aspect of integrating respect for human rights into their operations. Ultimately, this approach will help reduce human rights violations committed by the VDPs against civilian populations.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: This government action is part of the implementation of the concerted plan to train Volunteers for the Defence of the Fatherland in human rights and international humanitarian law, developed in 2023 by the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights and the Brigade of Volunteers for the Defence of the Fatherland in collaboration with actors from the United Nations system, NGOs and civil society organisations, including the CIFDHA. 
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National 
**Contribution of the programme**: CIFDHA's monitoring of human rights violations and abuses, with the support of AINL, has made it possible to document cases of alleged human rights violations attributed to the VDP. Taking these findings into account, CIFDHA has regularly recommended that the Ministry of Justice and the Ministry of Defence strengthen the human rights capacities of the VDPs in order to reduce violations against the civilian population. CIFDHA has also highlighted some of these findings in alternative reports submitted to United Nations treaty bodies, asking them to call on the Burkinabe State to strengthen the human rights capacity of the VDPs in order to reduce human rights violations. The treaty bodies have indeed taken up this recommendation with the Burkinabe State.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes. In addition to the CIFDHA, several other civil society actors, United Nations institutions, NGOs and the National Human Rights Commission have also advocated for strengthening the human rights capacities of the VDPs. Actors such as the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights and UNICEF have provided technical and financial support for the training of VDP human rights trainers.
