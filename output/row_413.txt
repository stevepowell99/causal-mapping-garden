**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In January 2023, the Dutch Minister of Defence indicated publicly that her call to pension funds to invest in arms producers should not be read as to mean in arms producers that export to dictatorships and human rights violators. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Over the second half of 2022, several officials high in the MoD had indicated they felt financiers needed to invest in arms producers. Without specification, this call seemed to ask investors to invest in any arms companies and disregard concerns around human rights that led to stricter policies in the past. In january 2023, the Dutch Minister of Defence indicated in a TV-show that she did not want banks and pension funds to invest in arms producers selling weapons to dictatorships, an important specification of previous statements by the Minister and other MoD officials.
