**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Ethiopia
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: Following the training on risk assessment and mitigation for HRDs and focal persons of university human rights clubs conducted in May 2024 in Ethiopia, HRDs were able to develop and rolled out risk mitigation plans to ensure their safety and continued operation.
**Significance of the outcome**: Several HRDs and members of university human rights clubs have constantly been at risk due to their work and the shrinking civic space context. In order for them to continue doing their work safely, it was important that a training in risk assessment and mitigation be offered to enable them to navigate their work-related challenges. The training built the capacities of the HRDs and members of the university human rights clubs in the assessment of potential risks and the development of mitigation measures to reduce the likelihood and severity of the risks and threats. This has enabled them to continue their work with minimal harm. For example, during the planned campaigns, a campaign at Jimma University was put on hold after the focal person reviewed the situation and realised it was risky for the student to engage. Additionally, a campaign at Ambo University switched from an outside campus peace walk to an indoor Labour Day event. Thus, the program enabled the HRDs to analyze potential risks. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: A five-day training was organised by EHRDC on risk assessment and mitigation from October 14 - 18, 2023. 16 HRDs from different parts of the country, especially conflict-prone areas were participated in the training. The training targeted the focal teachers from Universities that are in conflict-prone areas. The university HR clubs based in conflict-prone areas are often faced with challenges while conducting campaigns due to the outside environment risks. This requires training for focal teachers to enable them to assess potential risks, as they do not have previous training on risk mitigation and management.
