**FragmentID**: SCC-ETH2508/CIV005
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Ethiopia
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: On August 30, 2024, EHRDC delivered an oral statement to the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva as part of the UPR review process for Ethiopia, increasing scrutiny of the government in its role on the deteriorating situation of Human Rights Defenders and Civic Space. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The human rights situation in Ethiopia is characterised by arbitrary arrests, extrajudicial killings, enforced disappearances, curtailment of the freedoms of expression and assembly, repressive laws that seek to stifle voices for change, abrupt office raids, and confiscation of HRDs' equipment. High on the agenda was the dire need to bring the current operating environment in Ethiopia to the attention of the UN HRC in order to exert pressure on the state to influence policy and practice change. Since its inception, this was the first time that EHRDC submitted a shadow report and advocated for the government to restrain from reprisals against HRDs.  
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The last UPR cycle for Ethiopia took place in 2019. At the time, the civic space was characterised by progressive reforms/ laws and a functional state apparatus. In the aftermath of 2022, the human rights situation drastically declined, increasing risks for HRDs and organisations involved in human rights work. This warranted the need to bring to the attention of international human rights mechanisms to hold the state accountable for human rights violations in Ethiopia.
