**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In November 2023 the  Darfur Civil Society Platform for youths formed indirectly through PAX & Berghoff's initiative joined the  national youth platform called Sudan Youth Network (SYN). The SYN is now the main youth body in Sudan that is actively striving to support ending the war and to realise a civil democratic transformation in Sudan. 
**Significance of the outcome**: This is a significant change. The youth organisations in Darfur were missing an active platform for youth advocacy on political participation and representation. Darfur remains one of the most contested regions in Sudan and Africa in general. Conflict has never stopped in the area even before the war broke out in 2023, and the recent conflict only made it worse. The Sudan Youth Network has been existing and there were efforts to include youth from Darfur in the past years but it was not fruitful. PAX in partnership with the Berghof Foundation engaged youth from various civil society initiatives in Darfur, Eastern Sudan, and Khartoum in August 2023 as part of our So2 outcome 2.3 that intends to forge meaningfuful collaboration and positioning between civilian & pro-democarcy groups calling for the end of the war in Sudan. The engagements were done regionally and the Darfur group used this as an opportunity to continue networking with each other until they formed their own regional network which eventually fed into the national network of youth. We are proud to report that the Darfur Civil Society Platform has been very active as they immediately published their first statement against the war and they were well represented in the recently held founding conference of the Sudanese Youth Network for Ending War and Establishing Democratic Transition in March 2023 in Uganda.

**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Civic change agents
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: This is an unintended positive change  mainly because when PAX & Berghof engaged these youth, we had the intention to just create a platform for the youth to talk about their vision and demands on ending the war and possibly meet with some EU delegates working on Sudan. However, these youths from Darfur took a step further and went on to use this as an opportunity to strengthen their relations and create a timely needed platform for youths in Darfur. Darfur Youth were engaged in a 3-hour online conversation on 30.08.2023 and many issues were raised including the absence of a regional youth platform.﻿
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Not sure if there was any platform that influenced this besides us.
