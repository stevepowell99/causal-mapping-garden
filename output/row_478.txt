**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: At the 2024 UNGA First Committee, States demonstrated increasing recognition of the need to address pressing issues around armed drones through statements and formation of the Core Group of States on UAVs.
**Significance of the outcome**: For a long time, armed drones have been absent from the UN disarmament debate, untill Portugal's announcement of intention to champion this issue in 2023. As a follow-up to that announcement, Portugal initiated several joint initiatives around armed drones at the UN, including a Joint Declaration in early 2024, and formation of the Core Group of States on UAVs at the UNGA First Committee, which presented ideas for the next steps in the joint statement delivered in October 2024. In parallel, other States also drew more attention to this issue in their national interventions, in striking contrast to previous years when drones were rarely mentioned. Yet, there are still no concrete policy initiatives to address concerns around UAV proliferation.

**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: International community

**Contribution of the programme**: PAX has been championing this topic for a long time, producing analytical and advocacy materials for the First Committee, and was in touch with Portugal before over the issues, so there might have been some direct influence, but there are obviously broader influential processes - such as actual developments on the ground - that inform States' thinking on this matter.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, namely Portugal, who has been driving this issue at the UN level in 2024, other States concerned about drones due to ongoing developments, and other UN and civil society actors that produce research and raise awareness about this issue on the international level.
