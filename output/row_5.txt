**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: Since August 2021, following the formation of a network of 30 heroines and 16 male leaders from Titao and Ouahigouya by AFEDEB, there has been community awareness-raising, monitoring and an early warning system for signs of radicalisation and violent extremism in order to prevent the recruitment of children and young people into armed groups and reduce cases of radicalisation.
**Significance of the outcome**: The analysis of the context in April 2021 enabled AFEDEB to observe that many men and children in Ouahigouya and Titao were joining the ranks of extremist groups because of a lack of knowledge and information about the issues and seriousness of radicalisation and violent extremism. The analysis also revealed a lack of local strategy and action to prevent and reduce the recruitment of children and men by armed groups. This provides fertile ground for the growth of armed groups. In order to prevent and reduce cases of radicalisation, AFEDEB has set up a network of 30 female heroines and 16 male leaders in the two communes (Titao and Ouahigouya). Setting up the heroines has enabled the population to be informed about the early signs of radicalisation and violent extremism, and to inform the appropriate authorities if they are detected, so that appropriate action can be taken.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The heroines are women and girls committed to the search for peace and social cohesion within their communities. As for the male leaders, they are role models, ambassadors of peace identified within the communities. They raise people's awareness of the early signs of radicalisation and violent extremism, and also work to detect cases of radicalisation in order to sound the alarm. These players and this mechanism did not exist prior to the project's intervention.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Engaged citizens
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: PAX facilitated a session in April 2021 on analysing the context of the North region with the AFEDEB team which identified the factors and actors of radicalisation as well as the role of women in the search for peace and social cohesion. AFEDEB submitted a project on the involvement of women in the prevention of radicalisation and violent extremism in the Nord region, which was funded by PAX. AFEDEB then identified 30 women and girls and 16 male leaders involved in peace and conflict issues in their communities (including 10 women from Titao and 20 women from Ouahigouya). After their identification, these women, girls and men benefited from a 2-day training course (from 26 to 27 August 2021 in Ouahigouya) led by a consultant recruited by PAX on the prevention of violent extremism and radicalisation as well as the detection of early signs of radicalisation. The 30 women and 16 men also received training in leadership techniques and human rights on 26 September 2021. Since then, they have been leading educational talks in communities and households, helping to raise awareness among children, young boys, women and men of the behaviour they should adopt in the current context of insecurity.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The technical services (social action and local services) were involved in identifying the heroines. The social action department guided us to the Youba IDP site to identify heroines among the IDPs. The head of the IDP site and the Fulani leader were also involved.
