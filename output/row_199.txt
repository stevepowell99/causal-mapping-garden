**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In meetings held between RPW coalition members, 11.11.11 and Basma and Zeitouna, and Dutch and Belgium policy makers in Brussels in December 2022, EU policymakers agreed more explicitly with RPW recommendations related to establishing ways to monitor return. Also, they were willing to explore direct funding of refugee-led organizations.  
**Significance of the outcome**: One of RPW’s strategic priorities is to promote the role and work of Refugee-Led Organisations (RLOs) among international donors. RPW is urging donors to explicitly commit to accelerate aid localisation efforts and commitments, by pledging more resources to humanitarian, development, human rights, and peacebuilding projects and programmes by local civil society organisations and Refugee-Led Organisations (RLOs). As part of such localisation efforts, provide financial support to RLO initiatives, such as the Resourcing Refugees Leadership Initiative (RRLI) and its RLO-to-RLO fund.
