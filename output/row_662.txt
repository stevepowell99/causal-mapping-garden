**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Ethiopia
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In August 2023, (W) HRDs from the conflict-affected areas in Ethiopia (Afar, Amhara, and Tigray) experienced relief and healing from trauma following a training and wellbeing session on Trauma healing. 
**Significance of the outcome**: HRDs from Ethiopia’s conflict-affected regions of Amhara, Afar, and Tigray have faced severe episodes of stress and trauma arising from the conflict. Many of them witnessed sexual violence, arrests and torture, and several threats from conflicting parties. These mounted excessive stress and trauma on the HRDs. Convening of HRDS from the different regions in one space was an opportunity to share their experiences and provide insight into the magnitude of the impact of the conflict on their mental well-being. The training offered an opportunity to reflect, relax, and receive counselling for better mental health and trauma healing.  
**Additional information (use if needed) **: HRDs from conflict-affected regions, Amhara, Afar, and Tigray, in Ethiopia, had previously accused each other of inaction and silence. Through this activity conducted in Hawassa, Sidama Region, Ethiopia, they recognized that they share similar challenges and risks, despite the ongoing regional conflict in their respective regions. This fostered greater understanding and solidarity among them. This activity provided more insight among HRDs that felt that HRDs in other conflict-affected regions were not supportive or fully understanding the severity of their situation, even as victims fled to neighboring regions. The trauma healing and counselling sessions were an opportunity to reflect and release the stress and trauma.
