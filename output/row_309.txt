**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In December 2023, Abu Ali AlBasri, the head of the National Security Agency of Iraq, announced that the process for obtaining security clearance, essential for victims and survivors to receive compensation, will be simplified and expedited.
**Significance of the outcome**: Eligible families seeking compensation faced significant delays and obstacles in obtaining the necessary security clearance, a crucial part of their compensation application process, with approvals taking several months. A shorter delay for receiving compensation is one of the intermediary goals of the advocacy strategy.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Mr. Abu Ali's response indicated a move towards streamlining the process. He stated that security permits for those affected by HR abuses—including martyrs, the missing, and the injured—should be processed within the same governorate. This means that the subcommittees responsible for compensation should coordinate with the National Security Directorates to obtain the necessary security clearances locally, without the need to forward these applications to the Martyrs Foundation - Terrorism Victims Department in Baghdad. This decentralized adjustment will facilitate a more efficient and responsive compensation process for the affected families.

**Contribution of the programme**: Following the "Right to Know the Truth" conference organized by the Human Line Foundation on August 22, 2023, there were recommendations made to delegates about securing the rights of the families of the missing and eliminating delays in their compensation claims. Mr. Khaled Sultan Hashem, Ninewa's government representative, took charge of this issue, and conveyed the concerns of the families of the missing to national security, highlighting the major obstacle they face: obtaining security clearance. With thousands of compensation applications in Ninewa pending for years, resolving this issue was clearly urgent. The Human Line Foundation, together with Ninewa's representative Mr. Khaled Sultan Hashem, visited Mr. Abu Ali Al-Basri, the head of the National Security Service, in December 2023 at the National Security headquarters in Baghdad to lobby for the families' demands.
