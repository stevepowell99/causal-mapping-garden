**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In 2024, Khazaaen, with support of the program, launched its first interactive digital map on its website, compiling and displaying materials received into its archive that document global solidarity with Palestine and Gaza. This user-friendly platform marks a shift in Khazaaen’s archival practice toward accessible, digital, and geospatial forms of public engagement. It reflects a new approach to organizing and sharing archival content in ways that highlight both scale and location of transnational support.
**Significance of the outcome**: at the start of the war notebook project materials arriving at Khazaaen were archived but not presented normally within Khazaaen digital website. But on the creation of the digital map it helps to align with Khazaaen’s objective to make archival content more accessible and engaging. It transforms materials into an interactive public tool, enhancing visibility, outreach, and the collective documentation of international solidarity. The fact that Khazaaen traveled to the Netherlands before in light of the project and discussed and saw solidarity also contributed to the idea for the map. this is an important outcome on capacity change level; since it shows how Khazaaen as an organisation is making steps
