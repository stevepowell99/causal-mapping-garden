**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2508/PHR010
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Since 2023, the Fulani and Mossi communities in the canton of Louda in the Kuilssé region (north-central) that were once in conflict have been coexisting peacefully, which is evidenced by a clear reduction in conflicts, when comparing figures between 2021 and 2025.  
**Significance of the outcome**: Before 2023, relations between the Fulani and Mossi communities in the canton of Louda were particularly tense. The two groups lived side by side, but their coexistence was marked by mistrust, prejudice and recurring conflicts, linked in particular to access to land, the management of natural resources (water, grazing, crops) and historical tensions related to the settlement of internally displaced persons. The inclusion of others in the Keogo celebrations raised awareness among the population about living together and peaceful coexistence. This eased the climate of mistrust between ethnic groups. This effect is a major change in the behaviour of members of ethnic groups and is fully in line with SO 2 of the SCC programme. The integration of the theme of social cohesion into Keogo (the annual traditional festival of the canton of Boussouma), through the intervention of the RAJS/CN and the official opening of the event to all communities, including the Fulani, has created a positive change. For the first time, Fulani representatives were invited to actively participate in the festival, singing, storytelling and presenting their culture on an equal footing with the Mossi. This powerful act broke down a symbolic wall of exclusion. Since then, relations between the Fulani and Mossi have visibly improved: community leaders communicate more regularly, young people from both groups participate in activities together, and joint initiatives have been launched in the canton. This rapprochement is helping to ease tensions and lay the foundations for sustainable coexistence. This change is crucial because it reduces historical divisions, prevents violent inter-community conflicts and establishes a climate of trust through a cultural and participatory approach.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: This effect is not limited to passive coexistence: it marks a change in collective attitudes and behaviour, particularly among community leaders, young people and women. The programme has helped break down symbolic barriers of exclusion and identity-based withdrawal by promoting moments of mutual recognition and cultural participation. The inclusive organisation of Keogo served as an emotional and social catalyst, valuing diverse identities and showing that every community has a place in the public sphere. This effect is all the more significant given that it concerns a historically sensitive area (Louda), where coexistence between Fulani herders and Mossi farmers has been marked by cycles of tension. The two groups now interact more, reducing the risk of violent conflict. For instance, communities are increasingly organising joint activities such as the peace field established in 2023, which allows the Fulani, Mossi and internally displaced persons to cultivate a common field whose harvests are used to provide assistance to vulnerable people in the locality. This rapprochement has inspired other cantons and municipalities facing similar tensions.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Engaged citizens
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: This change is the direct result of awareness-raising, community dialogue and inter-community mediation activities carried out by RAJS/CN with the support of the programme in 2023. It is also the result of the integration of social cohesion and peace themes into the Keogo celebrations in 2023, thanks to advocacy and awareness-raising on the importance of living together within communities by the Dima of Boussouma. These actions have helped to build trust between community and religious leaders, while creating a safe and trusting environment for discussion between groups. Inclusive participation in Keogo then served as a lever to strengthen these ties. The programme has therefore helped to transform the perceptions and behaviours of both communities by addressing the root causes of mutual mistrust.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes. Community leaders facilitated rapprochement between communities through their personal commitment to dialogue. The Dima of Boussouma also supported this peace process by encouraging the inclusive participation of different ethnic groups. Furthermore, the willingness of local populations to turn the page on conflict, in the face of common challenges related to internal displacement and insecurity, played a catalytic role.
**Rating contribution**: great
**The change was unintended**: NO
**Evidence supporting the outcome statement**: See RAJS report 2023, 2024 Head of the Canton of Louda The programme's intervention has significantly reduced the number of conflicts in the north-central region during the period 2021 to 2025. According to ONAPREGECC's annual reports, there were 89 cases of conflict in 2021. In 2022, there were 81 documented cases of conflict, and in 2023, there were 53 cases. This number fell to 44 cases in 2024. There was also an increase in the number of conflicts resolved during the same period. Specifically, 7.4% of conflicts were resolved in 2022. 37.7% of conflicts were resolved in 2023, and 34.1% of conflicts were resolved in 2024. These figures and trends demonstrate the acceptance and openness of the population in favour of more peaceful coexistence compared to the past in the locality.
