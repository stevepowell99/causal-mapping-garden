**Outcome description**: Informal groups of young members of the ruling party (Imbonerakure) invited the chairman of a partner organisation to discuss the human rights situation in Burundi on WhatsApp and Telegram, 3 or 4 times in 2022, the last time on 22 October 2022.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before, the Imbonerakure made accusations over social media about the partner organisation supporting anti-government propaganda. The WhatsApp/Telegram discussions with the chairman show that they are open to dialogue on human rights. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Some groups among the Imbonerakure who are now being threatened and facing violations/retributions themselves, may be open to dialogue on human rights as they would like to make a plea for themselves/have the partner organisation advocate for them.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Engaged citizens
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: The partner organisation received training from DD and AINL (their supervisors including the chairman were trained between between March and July 2022) and also received institutional support to strengthen the organisation. Due to this, the partner carried out more in-depth activities and case reports and published more cases on social networks, which may have changed the mentality of young people in Burundi, including the Imbonerakure.
