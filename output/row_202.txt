**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On 12 December 2022, the law on the protection and responsibilities of human rights defenders (HRD) was adopted by the National Assembly of the Democratic Republic of Congo. This bill is composed of thirty articles and provides human rights defenders with rights, duties, obligations and mechanisms. In addition, this bill also sets out the penal provisions to which HRDs and violators of their rights will be subject. 
**Significance of the outcome**: In view of this deficiency and the ongoing violations against HRDs, some provinces have adopted edicts (provincial laws) to ensure the protection of HRDs in their entities, which is why the adoption of the "HRD" law by the National Assembly raises hopes for the effective protection of HRDs. The provincial edits cannot be applied to protect human rigths defenders (HRDs) at national level because provincial edits effective at provincial level. They vary one province to another. The nationwide HRDs law aims at standardizing the HRDs protection across the Democratic Republic of the Coongo (DRC). When the HRD law is ascended to by the president and it is therefore promulgated, all provincial edits will be null and void to pay way to the HRD law. It should be noted that this process will only be crowned if the Senate, to which it is sent for a second reading, adopts it in turn. Consequently, it will be transmitted to the Head of State for promulgation. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The initiative of specific legal protection mechanisms for human rights defenders started in the province of South Kivu, which had its edict adopted and promulgated on 16 February 2016. It was followed by the province of North Kivu, the province of Maniema, and currently the province of Tshopo where the initiative is in its final phase. The proposed HRD law at national level is the result of a long process since 2009.  However, similar initiatives in 2009-2010 and 2017 were rejected.
