**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In November 2024, during ABAAD’s “Expression Through Art in Times of Crisis” training, frontline staff and facilitators used artistic tools—such as drawing, collage, and color mapping—to express war-related stress and emotional burden. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The training became a safe space for emotional release and reflection, contributing to staff’s emotional resilience and strengthening their capacity to lead psychosocial support sessions. This outcome reflects a critical shift: the training moved beyond technical capacity-building to become a therapeutic space for frontline staff themselves. Amid widespread emotional fatigue following the war, it allowed staff to process secondary trauma, regain emotional balance, and reconnect with their role as facilitators. This emotional grounding directly enhanced the quality, empathy, and effectiveness of psychosocial support services offered to communities.
