**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In March and April 2025, two Yazidi women survivors from Sunini joined the Tribal Council (Justice Traditional Council) in Sunin, Sinjar. This marks a significant step forward in amplifying women's voices and advocating for women's rights within a traditionally male-dominated body. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Women in Sinjar and Ninewa in general have historically been excluded from leadership roles, particularly within tribal and male-dominated spaces. Through leadership and advocacy training provided by our grantee, Sinuni Organization, several female survivors from Sinjar have begun to break these barriers and step into public and decision-making roles. The recent inclusion of female survivors in tribal councils is a particularly significant step toward amplifying women’s voices and advancing their rights within local and tribal justice systems.
