**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In Mali in 2023, following the 187 recommendations made during the 2018 Universal Periodic Review, the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, Keeper of the Seals, involved several human rights organisations, including TRIJEUD-Mali and COMADDH, in the preparatory workshops (held on 13 and 27 December 2022 respectively at the Maeva Palace Hotel in Bamako, and on 5 and 24 January 2023 at the Radisson Collection Ex Sheraton Hotel) on the drafting of the national report for the 4th cycle of the Universal Periodic Review, and took account of the recommendations made by the ODDH in the draft bill on the Criminal Code and the Code of Criminal Procedure on 11 October 2023, incorporating provisions such as the criminalisation of slavery, human trafficking and the smuggling of migrants.
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to the collaboration with human rights organisations, the process of drafting the national report for the Universal Periodic Review was mainly internal to the Ministry of Justice and Human Rights, with limited participation from external parties. The involvement of human rights organisations in the preparatory workshops for the national UPR report represents a significant change as it strengthens the legitimacy and credibility of the human rights assessment process.
