**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Yemen
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In 2023, as a result of its expanded capacity and expertise to train on human rights monitoring and documentation (MDR), Mwatana conducted five MDR capacity-building workshops and trained a total of 70 human rights defenders in Sana'a and Aden, compared to zero workshops in previous years. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to building the capacity of Mwatana's team in monitoring and documentation (MDR) and providing legal support, as well as establishing the training unit, Mwatana wasn't able to train other CBOs and Human Rights defenders beyond its team. Those trainings were not part of the SCC programme's activities and the capacity gained in the programme allowed Mwatana to expand its scope of work in MDR using other projects and funds.
