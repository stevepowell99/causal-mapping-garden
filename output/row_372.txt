**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In December 2023, the ECCP's (European Coordination of Committees and Associations for Palestine) policy brief was influenced by CAC's statement presented in an advocacy mission in Brussels. ECCP's policy brief was distributed to the its network members and used in advocacy and lobby meetings at the level of the EU parliament and commission.
**Significance of the outcome**: The joint mission in December and influencing the ECCP’s policy brief is significant because the CAC was able to widen its network by connecting to advocacy groups across Europe, and through them to bring CAC’s analysis and research to the attention of the EU parliament and commission. In addition, through this new network, the CAC was able to share experiences with other members of the ECCP and by doing so, strengthen the capacity of the ECCP and its members.
