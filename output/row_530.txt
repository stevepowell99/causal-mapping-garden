**FragmentID**: SCC-DRC2508/PHR004
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Between 2023 and 2025, the governments of Uganda and Central African Republic (CAR) improved diplomatic relations between the two countries, fostering renewed military cooperations and plans for a major bilateral infrastructure project.
**Significance of the outcome**: Diplomatic, political, and military relations between the CAR and Uganda had been weak for a number of years when the peace dialogue started. From January 2023 onwards, PAX operated as the de facto intermediary between the  governments of the CAR and Uganda, and had to facilitate the diplomatic interventions, until bilateral relations improved to the point where the countries started using their own channels.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Improved diplomatic relations and cooperation between Uganda and the Central African Republic (CAR) are important to further the programme's goals towards quality reintegration of former Lord Resistance Army (LRA, a rebel group) fighters and their dependents and the  complete demobilization of the LRA. Furthermore, improved relations between the two countries are deemed positive factors for peace and security in the region.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: International
**Contribution of the programme**: PAX and its partner organization APRu initiated the DDR programme which brought these governments together. PAX frequently improved communication and coordination between these stakeholders. According to an external study, the CAR Minister of State in charge of DDRR "directly credited the PAX-APRu process for the improvement in relations between the two countries.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: No, PAX has played a key role in the reactivation of the bilateral relationship between CAR and Uganda during the year 2024. After the repatriation the governments had been restored, the diplomatic relationship and the role of PAX was limited to bilateral aspects of the reintegration and reunification process of the beneficiaries.                                As for the three following outcomes, we must note that the DDRR programme was over time co-funded by the Dutch embassy in Kampala ('Duk Gang' project), the Belgian government ('Kimia project') - in addition to SCC.
