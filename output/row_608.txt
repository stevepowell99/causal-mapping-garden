**FragmentID**: SCC-YEM2508/PHR013
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Yemen
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In 2025, 16 human rights defenders trained by Mwatana's Training & Development Unit  have actively started documenting protection concerns and human rights violations, reaching a total of 20 cases. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Building the MDR capacities of local civil society organizations and human rights defenders is key to sustainably promoting human rights in Yemen.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: With the support of AINL/HURICAP Mwatana’s Training & Development Unit has developed different resources (MDR guide / Legal Support Guide / Trainers' Manual) to help them develop specialized training materials for human rights defenders under other projects. For example, in 2025, under a European Union-funded project implemented with Oxfam, the guides (MDR in particular) were used in three training workshops targeting around 41 participants (lawyers, CSO members, and human rights defenders) outside the Mwatana team. Trainees have been submitting their plans to document incidents of violations in their areas after the training, and have already implemented several missions and documented several violations. To date, 16 of these defenders have actively started documenting protection concerns and human rights violations. Thus, the guides effectively contributed to building the capacity of the Training & Development Unit and are being used as foundational tools for designing future capacity-building programs.
