**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Since August 2023, Beza for Women has contributed to trauma healing for  women HRDs working in conflict areas in Dessie Amhara region to recover from stress and trauma resulting from the conflict.  
**Significance of the outcome**: The conflicts in the northern parts of Ethiopia between the TPLF and the federal goverment left many victims of human rights violations including women and children in Dessie town. Further conflict between the Fano milita and the federal government worsened the situation with further violence and trauma earlier experienced by the people in Dessie. Engaging in the trauma healing for the women in Dessie was important in coping and reducing the trauma to enable them forget the past experiences and continue engaging in their human rights work.
