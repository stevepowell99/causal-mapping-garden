**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2305/PHR013
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: Following actions led by PAX and its partner OCADES, 60 of the most influential political leaders in the eastern region of Burkina Faso pledged on 14 October 2021 to reconcile and promote peace within their communities.
**Significance of the outcome**: The involvement of political leaders in resolving crises is essential, especially in communities where people identify with their leaders. Because of political differences, political leaders in the East region no longer saw or spoke to each other. This led to a community crisis between the populations of the local towns and villages. This situation prompted PAX and its partner OCADES to organise consultations and raise the awareness of the region's most influential political and economic leaders so that they would engage in dialogue and commit to restoring peace among themselves and within their communities. The leaders accepted the dialogue and made an official commitment to peace through audio-visual messages calling for peace and unity among the sons and daughters of the eastern region. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: At the end of the consultations and dialogues facilitated by OCADES/CCRGS, 60 political and development leaders agreed to mobilise and launch appeals for peace, understanding and cohesion between the populations of the Eastern region. Messages were recorded and broadcast on TV and radio in French, Moore, Fulfulde and Gourmatcema.
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: Regional
**Contribution of the programme**: OCADES and CCRGS received support from PAX to analyse the context of the East region from 12 to 13 March 2021 in Koupéla. This enabled them to identify the problem of cohesion and living together, as well as the role that leaders could play in their region to consolidate peace. OCADES and CCRGS benefited from PAX's experience and advice in conducting peace dialogues in July 2021, which enabled them to learn about the approaches to be used to build peace actions at community level. The OCADES/CCRGS consortium then mapped influential leaders in the region during August 2021. In addition, they organised bilateral meetings (b to b) in September 2021 with political leaders in opposition, most of whom are in Ouagadougou, to raise their awareness of the perverse effects of conflicts of political origin and the importance of cleaning up the socio-political climate for a democracy at the service of peace. 20 of the most influential leaders agreed to take part in a dialogue during a scoping workshop on 18 September 2021, during which they analysed together the context of the East region and the effects of their actions on community conflicts in the region. Following this meeting of the 20 leaders, they met in Fada on 14 October 2021 with 40 other influential local leaders (60 leaders in total) to launch messages calling for peace, unity and development. The messages were broadcast on radio and television in December 2021. Some leaders told the dialogue forum that they had not sat down with others or greeted each other for years now. Several other people from the region said that these messages had helped to reduce the violent disagreements and opposition that existed between certain political activists.
