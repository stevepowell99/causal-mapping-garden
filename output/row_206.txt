**Contribution of the programme**: This second court case on Dutch arms transfers to Egypt, which started in November 2021, at a lower court in The Hague, PAX, together with PILP and Stop Wapenhandel, compiled a thoroughly researched case argueing that the transfer would violate (international) human rights. PAX provided and organised both legal input and most of the factual content.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: yes, PILP contributed at least half of the legal support; to much smaller extent Stop Wapenhandel was involved, mainly as supporting party.
