**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: The Minister of Justice ordered the release of Renathe Ndayishimiye, a woman residing in Gihanga commune, on November 12, 2022 from Bubanza prison, after four days of unjust detention. Her 4-year-old son was accused of raping a six-year-old girl, Renathe was falsely accused of encouraging her son. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The release of the mother of the young child shows that the government is susceptible to public pressure, which followed after the partner organisation published details about the victim and the case. A direct WhatsApp message of our partner to the Minister of Justice and the President made the former to order the release. Like other releases, this release had an impact on the whole population so that they would continue to denounce such cases and put pressure on local authorities, as that could reach farther than they would think.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The Minister of Justice herself telephoned the director of Rumonge Prison to order the release of Renathe Ndayishimiye. It was already nearly 8 p.m. The Minister was under strong public pressure after the FOCODE post (see column F).
