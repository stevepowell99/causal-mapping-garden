**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In December 2023, Zagros TV reached out to Haitham, a film director engaged in the project, to broadcast his project-funded documentary "Margins in Memory"
**Significance of the outcome**: The documentary sheds light on untold stories of ISIS survivors in Mosul and Hamdaniyya, especially highlighting the suffering and resilience of Muslim communities that remained under ISIS control for several years but categorically refused to be affiliated with the group and actively opposed the aggressions against minority groups, despite the violence and torture they faced and the immense economic pressure resulting of the siege and invasion. The documentary was first aired in August 2023 as part of the 8th commemoration of the genocide of the Yazidi population, organized by PFO. At the start of the project, the baseline analysis showed that victims of minority groups did not acknowledge the suffering of muslim communities at the hand of ISIS and refused to partake in intra-community storytelling exchanges. Airing the movie during the commemoration was in itself a considerable achievement for the project. By showing interest and broadcasting the documentary, Zagros TV - a national channel with a large audience in various regions of Iraq - would be contributing to significant transformations in community perspectives across the country
