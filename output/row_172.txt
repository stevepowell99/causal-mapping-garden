**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On 27th December 2022, Tony Nkina gained his freedom after the Ngozi court of appeal in Burundi dismissed his case based on lack of evidence to sustain the earlier 5 year sentence. Nkina had been illegally detained since 13th Oct 2020 and was sentenced to 5 years in prison. 
**Significance of the outcome**: HRDs have been arrested, harrased, illegally detained and wrongly accused in Burundi for disturbing the peace of the state. This is happening because the courts in Burundi lack independence and do not abide to the principles of due process. The dismissal of Tony Nkina's case signifies a positive response from the judicial arm of the Burundian government in adherence to international/regional/national calls for human rights standards.
