**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: On 27 June 2025, one WHRD trained by AI sent two more detailed interview reports, including concrete statements with gripping accounts of rape and its impacts, that can be used as quotes of survivors in reports on Conflict-Related Sexual Violence
**Significance of the outcome**: The WHRD sent her first two interview reports on 20 May 2025, after a first field mission to the conflict area. These reports lacked many details on the actual incidents that happened, though it contained some information about the impacts of the events. The second report showed significant improvements.

**Contribution of the programme**: From 14 to 18 October 2024, AINL and AI's researcher and campaigner from the Regional Office in Nairobi held a training in documenting human rights violations for 12 HRDs from various conflict areas of Ethiopia. This was followed up by various online engagements (audio calls and text messages) with the concerned HRD(s) to enable and coach them to do proper and useful documentation, from Nov-Dec 2024 through June 2025.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Not really, as I believe we were the only human rights organization working directly with this WHRD
