**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: During a session on gender equality conducted with community groups on August 31st 2023 in the municipality of Maarakeh, South Lebanon, the municipality's president interrupted and terminated the session because, in his opinion the content was correlated with sexual orientation and the facilitator was spreading toxins.
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to this incident, the project facilitator conducted the community group sessions within the municipality of Maarakeh in coordination and with prior permission from the municipal president. However, the first sessions faced challenges whenever discussions centered on gender where some participants raised concerns on the use of the word "gender" and relating it with sexual orientation which triggered backlash. This outcome is significant because not only did it lead to the termination of the session by the municipal president, jeopardizing the Country Programme objectives of fostering positive engagement and dialogue on sensitive topics related to gender equality within the community. It is also illustrative of Lebanon's wider shift towards increasing conservatism and rejection of programmes promoting women's rights and freedoms. Apart from this incident, ABAAD has received other threats against its staff for similar programming and has had to make adjustments to implementation to ensure the safety of all its staff.

**Contribution of the programme**: As part of the project plan, ABAAD facilitators coordinated with the municipality of Maarakeh Village in the South to establish 2 community groups, where 12 training sessions would take place in the municipality as a prerequisite of the initiatives. At the first session, a discussion on gender topics raised concerns from some participants related to the disussions and terminologies related to "gender", triggering backlash. After discussion with the municipal members on the sessions' content, during the forth session titled "Gender and Sex", the president of the municipality addressed the facilitator disrespectfully demanding the immediate halt of the community group sessions, mocking the topics discussed, saying, "Enough with stories unrelated to women's rights and their relationship with their husbands. Why talk about gender?" This was an unintended negative outcome affecting/ending the intervention in the area.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, the community group sessions' content and topics related to gender were the main factor leading to the termination of the sessions in this village. However, the organized online anti-gender campaigns targeting civil society organizations including ABAAD, could have affected the participants leading them to the debate during the session, subsequently terminating the session by the municipal president. This wasn't a one-off incident but a result of an effective anti-gender equality movement.
