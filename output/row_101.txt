**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On 16th September 2022, the military and the chiefs in Mugwo Payam of Yei River County, Central Equatoria State, South Sudan, agreed to cooperate and coordinate monthly security meetings to safeguard the safety of the community and their property after the three day civil-military peace dialogue. This has built confident among civilians and encouraged return of refugees from Uganda and Democratic Republic of Congo to Yei River County.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before this engagement the relationship between the civilians and military was not good. Military blamed civilians to be rebels, saying ‘they are your children, so you need to talk to them.’ Civilians were therefore beaten up.  Returnees will be captured by military saying ‘he was a rebel before’. Now returnees need first to report to the chief. Before it was not easy to identify who conducted ambushes, now it is clear that it was done by a gang-group. Community dialogues enabled people to point out who conducted the ambush. After this, the ex-soldiers conducting the ambushes were arrested and 3 killed in action. Since this happened the ambushes between Morobo and Mugo have stopped
