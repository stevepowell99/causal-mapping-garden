**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In December 2024, after attending the Berlin meeting organised by Justice for Life, the Syrian Democratic Council, the de facto authority in NE Syria, reached out to Justice for Life to consult them in some of their decisions related to better managing inclusive governance in northeast-Syria.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before the conference, there was a lack of communication and trust between the authorities and civil society organisation, but the period after that witnessed an increase in the number of meetings and encounters between the de facto authority and JfL. The fact that the de facto authority now consults with JFL means that JFL is able to bring attention of authority on existing shortcomings and possible solutions which can be put in place to enhance inclusive governance.
