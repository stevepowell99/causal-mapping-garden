**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In February 2024, the Dean of the College of Education at the University of Mosul asked the Ninewa Women’s Organization to sign a memorandum of understanding to annually celebrate International Women’s Day and highlight the role of Ninewa's women in peacebuilding
**Significance of the outcome**: In Ninewa, the observance of Women's Day and the organization of activities that underscore women's participation, issues, and human rights, have been uncommon among government and civil institutions. The Ninewa Women's Organization, a feminist group focused on transitional justice, has seized greater opportunities since becoming involved in the project. It has played a pivotal role in amplifying the voices of women from marginalized communities to policymakers and governmental spheres. The MoU with the university of Mosul highlights a potential shift in the behavior and attitude of academics towards more feminist principles, despite the overall gender backlash experienced in Iraq in 2023.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The Ninewa Women's Organization is one of the grant recipients and was established at the beginning of the project by a group of female volunteers with similar feminist principles. It relies on the financial support provided by the project. It is a feminist organization and is led by a young woman with a team of young feminist women from multiple components.
