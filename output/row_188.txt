**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2305/PHR022
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Thanks to the "Heroines of Peace against Radicalisation" project, communities have been sensitised with a view to reducing cases of stigmatisation of Fulani women and conflicts linked to religion, through educational talks, radio broadcasts and theatre forums organised by the partner AFEDEB in the north of the country.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before, at the start of and during the project, many people, especially women, refused to associate or sit with Fulani women because the Fulani are considered to be responsible for the insecurity in our country. There are also misinterpretations of religious texts that aggravate inter- and intra-religious conflicts. The words/opinions of religious leaders are important for deconstructing misunderstandings and interpretations in order to prevent and resolve conflicts. The guidance and advice of religious leaders have helped to change the behaviour of parents, especially Muslims and Protestants, who were opposed to their sons or daughters marrying people of other religions.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The heroines of peace and male leaders were able to report to religious leaders (Muslim, Catholic and Evangelical) and conduct joint awareness-raising campaigns, which increased people's knowledge and reduced conflicts based on religion.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Engaged citizens
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: After receiving training in advocacy and community mobilisation (July 2021) organised by PAX, the AFEDEB leaders carried out an analysis of the stakeholders and their influence in building peace in the northern region. Religious leaders (Muslims, Catholics, Protestants, traditional religions) were identified during the awareness-raising and advocacy sessions so that they could engage in dialogue and help to raise awareness among the population about the values of peace and the behaviour to adopt in order to avoid conflicts based on religion. The religious leaders accepted and adhered to the process and participated in radio broadcasts bringing together the religions, and through a visual communication campaign with posters showing the Bishop of Ouahigouya, the Grand Imam of Ouahigouya, the Grand Pastor of Ouahigouya as well as the Saab-Naaba (Minister of Social Cohesion of the Kingdom of Yatenga) in the streets of the city of Ouahigouya.
