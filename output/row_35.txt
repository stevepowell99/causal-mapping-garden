**FragmentID**: SCC-INT2305/ESF007
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: End of December 2021, the Dutch government confirmed that it will start working on national level due diligence legislation. In February 2022, the European Commission published a proposal for EU-wide mandatory due diligence legislation, the Corporate Sustainability Due Diligence Directive. In October 2022, 6 political parties in the Netherlands re-tabled the parliamentary proposal for national level due diligence legislation.
**Significance of the outcome**: Currently, the international standards on responsible business conduct (the UNGPs and OECD Guidelines) are soft law. Soft law is not effective enough in making companies respect human rights; companies should be obliged by law to conduct human rights due diligence in order to effectively prevent, end and/or remediate adverse human rights impacts. In 2021 and 2022 both the European Commission as well as several member states in the EU have started implementing mandatory due diligence legislation (France, Germany) or have published or announced legislative proposals (the EU, the Netherlands).
**Additional information (use if needed) **: 
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: The step towards mandatory due diligence legislation for companies is largely the result of years of lobby, advocacy and campaigning by civil society, trade unions and other stakeholders. In the Netherlands, the Dutch CSO coalition for responsible business conduct (MVO platform), to which PAX is a member, has played a huge role in getting the Dutch government to commit to the development of legislation. On the level of the EU, the European Coalition for Corporate justice (to which the MVO Platform is a member) has played a similar role. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Actors: I assume progressive actors within the governments, as well as progressive (social impact) companies and growing societal movements (i.e. on climate change) showing the importance of stronger corporate accountability. 
**Rating contribution**: moderate
**The change was unintended**: NO
