**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In August 2025, a parliamentary report issued by the Joint Committee on Finance, Public Expenditure, Public Service Reform and Digitalisation, and Taoiseach in Ireland addressing Ireland’s role in authorizing the sale of Israeli bonds within the EU system based on a legal expert statement presented by Dr. Munir Nuseibah on behalf of the Community Action Centre (CAC) in June 2025.
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to this outcome, CAC had not been formally recognized as a legal contributor to foreign parliamentary processes. This invitation and the resulting influence on the Committee’s recommendations mark a major step forward in CAC’s ability to shape policy decisions beyond Palestine. The outcome is significant because it demonstrates CAC’s growing credibility and influence in international legal and political spaces. The Committee’s report includes 15 recommendations, many of which reflect CAC’s framing of international law obligations, including references to the ICJ Advisory Opinion, the Genocide Convention, and the responsibility of state organs. This aligns directly with CAC’s objective of enforcing international human rights standards and expanding its capacity to push for legal accountability.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The intervention was part of a public hearing, during which Dr. Nuseibah presented CAC’s legal analysis and responded to questions from parliamentarians. The Committee’s final report explicitly acknowledges CAC’s contribution and includes references to its arguments. This outcome also strengthens CAC’s relationship with Irish civil society organizations, who are leading campaigns against the authorization of Israeli war bonds in Europe.
