**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In August 2023, Ouédraogo Wendpouiré Fatimata, a beneficiary of the peace and social cohesion talks led by heroine Ouédraogo Ramata, resolved a family dispute between two neighbours, Ouédraogo Zoénabo and Porgo Koulssouma, in sector 10 of Tamssin in Ouahigouya/Yatenga province/Northern region of Burkina
**Significance of the outcome**: In the northern region, family disputes between neighbours are common. These are usually small fights between children that turn into conflicts between mothers who want to defend their children. These are conflicts that are generally settled out of court through the intermediary of other people, to avoid the traditional justice system, which can undermine good relations and social cohesion. This is an important effect because it is directly in line with our change 2, which is to reduce social conflicts within communities by involving religious leaders through theatre forums, panels and workshops

**Contribution of the programme**: Ouédraogo Zoénabo and Porgo Koulssouma are neighbours and hit each other because of their children. Ouédraogo Zoénabo's husband, in support of his wife, laid a hand on Porgo, who was injured in the face. Porgo's husband did not want to retaliate and decided to take Zoénabo's husband to court. It was then that Ouédraogo Wendpouiré Fatimata, the beneficiary of talks on peace and social cohesion, intervened and was able to reconcile the neighbours. She showed both parties the importance of social cohesion and the consequences of conflict. Zoénabo's husband acknowledged his wrongdoing, as did his wife, and asked Porgo and his wife for forgiveness, which they accepted. He also voluntarily assumed responsibility for the medical expenses. Porgo's husband finally dropped the complaint.The contribution is indirect: Ouédraogo Wendpouiré Fatimata is not involved in the project. She benefited from the talks on peace and cohesion given by our heroine Ouédraogo Ramata.The contribution is great: the family dispute was settled out of court and was not brought before the traditional courts. If it were brought before the traditional courts, the law would certainly be upheld, but the conflict could spread to the extended families of both parties, which would not be good for social cohesion. The change is positive and intentional: the conflict has been resolved to the satisfaction of both parties. The neighbours are now talking to each other and there is nothing to indicate that the conflict may reignite.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: YES The effect was achieved by Ouédraogo Wendpouiré Fatimata, who is not involved in the project.
