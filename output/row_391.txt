**Outcome description**: In Burkina Faso, the Bangrin reception site for internally displaced persons set up a site management committee on 19 September 2023 after a leadership conflict was resolved. This conflict prevented the site stakeholders from electing the members of the committee. 
**Significance of the outcome**: In March 2023, on the basis of a diagnosis, the social action decided to renew the members of the management committee of all the sites for internally displaced persons in the municipality of Kaya. As a result, several sites were able to renew their committees, with the exception of 04 sites that were experiencing difficulties. One of these sites was Bangrin, where the problem was due to a leadership dispute within an ethnic community living on the site. Indeed, 02 lists of committee members were put forward, but none of these lists had unanimous support within the site, because frustrations, grudges and rumblings were heard in the community, which risked leading to confrontations. The mission of this programme is to contribute to :     Resolve this conflict, which is preventing humanitarian actors from intervening at the site, Strengthen social cohesion between the people living there

**Contribution of the programme**: The project's contribution is direct in that the Sanmatenga canton chief is one of the project's direct beneficiaries. In 2021, the canton chiefs benefited from capacity building and became peace ambassadors who have been promoting social cohesion within their communities since 2021. The canton chief of Sanmatenga is one of the beneficiaries of this process (peace ambassador). He contributed to the focus group (09 to 10 August 2023) to diagnose the problem following the training course on conflict transformation organised by RAJS/Kaya on 11 and 12 August 2023. Subsequently, at the end of August 2023, he intervened with the Bangrin IDPs to call on the leaders and encourage them to abandon the 02 lists and propose a single list whose members are accepted by all.  One of the focus group's recommendations was to set up a group of wise men to deal with conflicts on the site.  
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The social action managers at the Bangrin site facilitated access to the site and the identification of key players.
