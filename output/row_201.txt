**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2305/PHR003
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In July 2022, in a meeting in Ngozi with members of the Burundian diaspora visiting Burundi, the President of the Republic of Burundi declared that he was aware of abductions and disappearances committed notably by state agents following communications from FOCODE on enforced disappearances.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before the intervention, the President of the Republic denied that there were enforced disappearances in Burundi (for example, in an interview dated 14 July 2021 with RFI and France24).  On 29 Dec 2021, the President changed position a little, recognising that "abductions take place, [...] committed by terrorist groups". Then finally, his statement in Ngozi on 22 July 2022 clearly recognised that "abductions and disappearances take place [...] committed by security forces". This sent a message to state agents that it's not acceptable to make people disappear. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Unfortunately, the President has not launched concrete actions to put an end to these human rights violations.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: After President Evariste Ndayizimiye first denied the existence of enforced disappearances, FOCODE protested and denounced this statement in a public declaration on 16 July 2021. A month later, FOCODE organized a campaign with 5 virtual public conferences with i.a. testimonies of victims' families. Then in September 2021, FOCODE spoke about enforced disappearances at the UN Human Rights Council. Faced with this pressure, the President may have started changing his position, contributing to his statement in Ngozi in July 2022. Then in August 2022, FOCODE published a letter to the President of the Republic informing him that at least 80 people disappeared during the reign of President Evariste N. In writing the letter, FOCODE used the knowledge acquired during the MDR training by AINL; more specifically: some language is now more specific (such as the use of "violation" vs. "abuse"), while there has gradually been more attention also to proper interviewing and the verification of specific details in the cases.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Publications by FOCODE without the support of the SCC (see previous column; AINL only started supporting FOCODE in 2022). Social media posts and the campaign fully managed by FOCODE itself contributed greatly (the Chairman has 118,000 followers on Twitter and 320,000 on Facebook). Other, mostly Burundian media also contributed.
