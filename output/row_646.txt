**Year**: 2025

**Significance of the outcome**: The gradual deradicalisation of extremist detainees in the high-security prison in Ouagadougou is a unique and unprecedented action of the SCC programme in Burkina Faso.

**Scale**: Individual
**Contribution of the programme**: PAX has been working collaboratively since 2023 to design a specific project for the High Security Prison (PHS). In 2024, a series of training courses was organised for 70 prison staff on preventing and combating radicalisation and violent extremism in prisons; 30 staff members received training in psychosocial care for prisoners convicted of terrorism; brigade leaders were trained in human rights; a manual comprising 16 modules was designed and approved by all relevant actors, including Islamic religious umbrella organisations in Burkina Faso, with the support of the Cercle d'Etudes, de Recherches et de Formation Islamiques (CERFI); the manual was translated into Arabic. Six (06) imams were identified and trained in the use of the manual; Since September 2024, 187 prisoners classified as "highly radicalised" have been receiving Islamic religious education with a view to deconstructing misinterpretations of religious texts. PAX has also installed sound systems in the PHS visiting rooms to enable all prisoners to follow religious teachings and civic and citizenship education.
