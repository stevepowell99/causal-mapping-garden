SSUDEMOP also held a meeting for these 7 young women with the Secretary General  of the National Constitution Review Commission to discuss entrypoints for young women in the reconstituted National Constitution Review Committee. These engagements created an opportunity for these young women to increase their understanding on the constitution making process and built their confidence to proactively engage in the process. The one woman selected for these institutions were part of these two SSUDEMOP led engagements
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The 35% affirmative action for women in the revitalized peace agreement, which should apply for all public institutions according to the constitution, has created an opportunity for more women's engagement in processes like the constitution making. This affirmative action was highly advoacated for by women leaders and peace activists. More stakeholder groups have become advocates and supporters for women participating in decision-making at national and sub-national levels. Community Empowerment for Progress Organisation (CEPO), SSuDEMOP, South Sudan Council of Churches (SSCC) and DRI have been influential stakeholder groups involved in this process.
