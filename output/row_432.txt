**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In January 2024, a woman from Bashiqa, along with five other people from Hamdaniya, Nimrud, and Mosul, successfully had their compensation requests approved by the compensation department, overcoming previous rejections and suspensions.
**Significance of the outcome**: The communication gap between survivors and government institutions has significantly undermined the ability of thousands of victims to navigate the complex legal procedures necessary to complete an application for compensation. This gap has led many to either abandon their pursuit of compensation or face the rejection of their applications due to inaccuracies or the absence of required documentation. This lack of awareness and understanding has left thousands of victims without the means to access justice. By directly engaging the most vulnerable groups of society, the project is successful in enabling reparations for victims partaking in initiatives.

**Scale**: Individual
**Contribution of the programme**: In 2022 and 2023, PAX and AINL provided capacity building and ToTs for the partners on transitional justice mechanisms in Iraq and international justice mechanisms. Subsequently, PFO arranged a specialized two-day training workshop on victim reparations for the network of advocates, held on October 21, 2023. This workshop, co-led by the judge of Ninewa's First Compensatory Committee, equipped participants with essential legal knowledge around the victim compensation mechanism in place. This also enabled them to identify gaps in the mechanism, allowing for better informed advocacy initiatives. Since the network of advocates is essentially composed of victims and survivors, this information was particularly beneficial to them on a personal level, as was the case with 6 of the advocates including Reham. Moreover, Reham and the five other advocates had the chance to engage directly with the judge, who explained the reasons for application rejections and offered advice on securing their acceptance. Ultimately, all six applications were approved in January 2024.
