**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2305/PHR025
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Following the monitoring of the prison situation of detainees in the High Security Prison and the advocacy work undertaken by civil society actors, the Government of Burkina Faso and the prison security guards in particular have committed themselves to improving respect for human rights in the prison environment and to punishing abuses and violations by revising the rules governing the discipline of prison security guard personnel on 30 December 2022. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The purpose of revising the regulations governing the discipline of prison security guard staff is to correct the shortcomings noted in Decree No. 2012-118/PRES/PM/MJPDH/MFPTSS/MEF governing the discipline of prison security guard staff, and to make the offences and related penalties more explicit in order to promote greater respect for human rights in Burkina Faso's prisons.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Improving respect for human rights in prisons requires the involvement of all the key players, in particular the prison security guards, in order to bring about changes in their attitudes towards detainees, as the humanisation of prisons and respect for the human rights of detainees also depend on the accountability of GSP staff. A review of the decree had already been started by the prison administration, but the process had stalled due to political instability (coup d'état in January 2022) and a lack of financial resources to finalise the process. This revision was no longer a priority for the government authorities at the time.  
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: In 2021, during the monitoring of the prison situation at the PHS, some inmates complained of ill-treatment and behaviour towards them by prison security officers without this behaviour being punished. CIFDHA was granted an advocacy hearing with the Director General of the Prison Service on 9 September 2022, during which these issues were raised. The directorate referred to the inadequacy and shortcomings of the current disciplinary regulations. At the request of the General Management of the Prison Service, PAX financed the workshop to validate the new texts proposed for review. On 17 October 2022, CIFDHA took part in a consultation workshop to review the decree adopted by the Council of Ministers on 30 December 2022.    
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The prison administration and prison security officers took part in the review of the disciplinary regulations.
