**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: On the 5th of December 2022 the military state actors of Sudan agreed to sign a political framework agreement with dozens of civilian leaders at the Republican Palace in Khartoum. This came after all efforts to materialize the October 2021 coup failed due to the pressure from various pro-democracy local and international actors.  
**Significance of the outcome**: This is a significant outcome because the military state actors staged a coup in October 2021 which derailed all the progress that was done by the transitional government including the PoV planning. The coup never materialized because local and international prodemocracy actors mounted pressure on them through various actions, such as weekly demonstrations in Sudan, political dialogues and some international restrictions on Aid and economic support were imposed on the coup government. Since the October 2021 coup, there was no clear legitimate government and no significant steps were done by the coup government to fully consolidate power, prodemocracy actors in Sudan demonstrated almost twice a week although they were met with massive violence from the state securities. Hundreds were killed and injured, but this did not stop the demonstrations as people continued to storm the various cities of Sudan especially Khartoum. In August 2022, the Deputy Head of the Sovereign Council acknowledged the failure of their military coup to achieve its objectives in an interview with the BBC TV Arabic Service. This work is in line with So2.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: It is important to note that the newly agreed political deal, has not been welcomed by all pro-democarcy forces because they left out important actors,  including several opposition parties, the resistance committees and a number of ex-rebel groups. Therefore they are still protesting

**Contribution of the programme**: KACE (PAX partner) felt the necessity of restoring the unity amongst the prodemocarcy forces to defeat the military coup. So, they started their own initiative in January 2022. They held 20 separate meetings with academics, civil society leaders, representatives of Khartoum-based Resistance Committees, the two factions of Professional Associations, prominent intellectuals known as “national personalities”, as well as representatives of political parties, namely the Sudanese Communist Party (SCP), Baathist Party, Umma Party, SPLM/N, and the Sudan Congress Party which were all successful in creating resistance to the coup. KACE also created a five-people-committee to draft the common ground charter and present it to all forces for discussions, amendments and approval. The final approved draft was called “the Charter for the Completion of the December Revolution” (CCDR). KACE then created The Charter For Completion of The December Revolution Facebook page to facilitate further discussions. although this was not very successful, it again helped to keep the momentum of resistance going on. A number of CSOs also tried to unify prodemocarcy forces and one of the main platform, the Mechanism of Unifying the Forces of the Revolution (AWQID), KACE is one of the founders and supported it in many ways. KACE contributed to the provision of its vision and mission as well as nomination of individuals with high integrity and undoubted credentials. KACE also one of the main providers of financial support. KACE also supported the RCs by providing training in leadership, security and protection, documentation and provided protection gears for frontliners, namely ghadiboon (Absolutely Angry), Mutoqadimat (all female frontliners), and Milook al Ishtibak (Kings of Engagement).  KACE also contributed significantly to a parallel initiative to form an organization that unify the individuals who works on enlightenment and democracy including academics, intellectuals, writers, and opinion formers (The Forces of Democracy & Enlightenment) (Mutoqadim). To build grasroots resilience, Harisat (PAX) partner trained 75 Youth (males and female) from the resistance committees and community  groups  on first aid of psychosocial support services (FAPS) and referral process for emergency cases.  Youth (males and females) in Khartoum state also received free structured and professional psychosocial support through (Tele counseling and physical) individual and group therapy sessions. They also created three community-based psychosocial support groups  to provide prevention and response services in the project areas in Khartoum. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The African Union (AU) suspended Sudan’s membership the day after the coup, while the U.S. and European Union froze hundreds of millions of dollars of development assistance they had pledged to support Sudan’s transition. Aid programs from the International Monetary Fund and World Bank potentialy worth billions of dollars ground to a halt, as did critical debt relief negotiations. Progress toward a deal came through a separate channel. The U.S. and Saudi Arabia, which form the backbone of the Quad (a group of external partners that also includes the UK and UAE), facilitated parallel direct talks between the main FFC bloc and the military. The Trilateral Mechanism which comprised of the United Nations Integrated Transition Assistance Mission in the Sudan (UNITAMS), African Union and the Intergovernmental Authority on Development (IGAD) facilitated most of the formal discussions.
