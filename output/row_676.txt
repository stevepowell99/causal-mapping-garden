**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: One HRD who participated in the Amnesty International training in October 2024, applied the training directly when working with Amnesty International to document the brutal U.S. airstrike in Yemen that killed and injured Ethiopian detainees. I interviewed 15 survivors (13 Tigrigna speakers, 2 Amharic speakers), applying trauma-sensitive and ethical interviewing skills, following safeguarding policies, and ensuring the sessions were conducted with empathy and without retraumatization. I then carefully transcribed and translated the interviews into English, adding contextual notes to clarify cultural elements and observations for staff.
