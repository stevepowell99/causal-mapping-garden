**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2305/CIV007
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Niger
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Through the knowledge acquired during the strategic litigation workshop held in September 2022 in Niamey, Niger, human rights defenders (HRDs) from the Sahel region learnt about regional mechanisms, including the Economic Community of West African States (ECOWAS) court, before which HRDs can lodge complaints for violations of human rights when national mechanisms do not meet their expectations.  It should be noted that, as far as ECOWAS is concerned, HRDs do not need to exhaust domestic remedies.  As a result, for the first time in the history of Nigerien HRDs, the Réseau Nigérien des Défenseurs des Droits Humains (RNDDH) brought case before the ECOWAS court, calling on the government of Niger to drop the charges against HRD Abdoulaye Seydou and release him.
**Significance of the outcome**: The government of Niger has a history of using the judicial system to arbitrarily arrest and illegally detain human rights defenders in order to silence them.  The monitoring, documentation and reporting of human rights violations and abuses is important for the safety, security and protection of Nigerien citizens and human rights defenders. The Niger Human Rights Defenders Network (RNDDH) is also important for guaranteeing access to justice for human rights defenders who have been arbitrarily arrested and illegally detained. This will enable them to continue to carry out their human rights work.  With the failure of access to justice for human rights defenders at risk through the judicial system in Niger, the use of regional mechanisms becomes very powerful in extending access to justice for human rights defenders and enabling them to continue to do their work.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Previously, human rights defender Abdoulaye Seydou had been prosecuted for publishing information likely to disturb public order. The day the Nigerien government dropped the charges, it re-arrested human rights defender Abdoulaye Seydou on further charges of complicity in the burning of sheds at the Tamou gold mining site. Human rights defender Abdoulaye Seydou monitored, documented and reported human rights violations and abuses committed by the Nigerien military at the Tamou gold mining site, mistaking fleeing terrorists for gold miners.
