**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In June 2024, Awasem, a 45-year-old Lebanese woman from Baalbek, married with four children, took concrete steps towards prioritizing her own well-being by dedicating personal time and space for activities beyond her usual family responsibilities. She began attending weekly fitness classes, set aside one afternoon per week for reading and reflection, and joined a local women’s discussion group.
**Significance of the outcome**: Baalbek, located in the Bekaa Valley, is a traditional area where cultural norms assign women primary responsibility for family care, household duties, and meeting the family’s needs. Women often play the role of self-sacrificing caregivers who suppress their own needs to support others. Awasem's change represents a meaningful shift in this context.
