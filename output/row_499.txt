**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In December 2024, both displaced women (from Syria and South Lebanon) and Tripoli residents created a WhatsApp group to serve as a space for emotional support during the conflict.
**Significance of the outcome**: Tripoli has a very divided, sectarian and complex social fabric. Many people have fled to Lebanon from Syria after the fall of the Assad regime, and this has led to a lot of mistrust within communities. Many Syrian refugees are facing discrimination and hatred amongst arrival. For people displaced from the South, it is a highly traumatic and difficult period. The fact that women from these communities came together and created a mutual support system shows that they are themselves overcoming these divisions and showing that humanity, empathy and support trump them.
