**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In May 2023, the annual UNSC Protection of Civilians (PoC) week featured the Environment, Peace and Security (EPS) agenda: the UN Secretary General's annual PoC report included sections on the need to protect the environment as part of PoC efforts, while X Member States' endorsed the EPS agenda in their statements.
**Significance of the outcome**: Traditionally, Member States have avoided including protection of the environment as part of their security-focused deliberations at UNSC, but over the past few years, UN Secretary General was keen to include it in his PoC agenda. UN Secretary General's report from 2022 incorporated the section on the protection of the environment in armed conflicts, but the repetition of this practice in 2023 makes this practice systemic and contributes to mainstreaming the EPS agenda across the UN system.
