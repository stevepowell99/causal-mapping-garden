**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: On 8 May 2025, the Dutch Embassy in Beirut requested and oversaw the organization of an in-person donor briefing with RPW and multiple international stakeholders.  
**Significance of the outcome**: This marked a shift from 2024, when RPW had independently organized an online donor briefing. Previously, donor engagement with refugee-led analysis in Lebanon was limited and largely driven by civil society actors, with diplomatic missions like the Dutch Embassy rarely initiating follow-up or deeper involvement. By initiating an in-person donor briefing with RPW, inviting other international donors, the Dutch Embassy in Beirut acknowledged particular reliability, access and expertise of RPW by way of proactively associating themselves with a refugee-led coalition. The change is significant because it indicates increased recognition of RPW’s credibility, ability to build and maintain strong relations and ultimately influence, enabling stronger advocacy on refugee protection ahead of critical decision-making moments and during a volatile situation in Lebanon and Syria. The change also reflects deeper engagement by a key diplomatic actor in RPW’s evidence-based advocacy work as well as increased trust in the work of the coalition in specific and in civil society in general.

**Scale**: National 
**Contribution of the programme**: RPW organized an online donor briefing in 2024, targeting key diplomatic actors in Lebanon, including the Dutch Embassy and a U.S. representative, to present findings and recommendations from its annual report. Due to its relevant qualitative and quantitative data complementing each other, and the knowledge of the coalition consisting of Lebanese organizations, RLOs and EU organizations, the event was repeated in 2025 in an in-person format and guided by the new annual report with new findings grounded in the changed political context. The online briefing in 2024 was part of a series of donor briefings to the Dutch Embassy in Beirut throughout 2024 by RPW members, amongst others in Beirut during the 2024 RPW strategic retreat in February, informal meetings in The Hague with the Dutch MFA as well as many meetings with other donors, at EU level, at the Protection Cluster through UNHCR and to other NGOs.
