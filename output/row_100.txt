**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Since October 2022, the defence and security forces have been providing security and protection for civilians wishing to return to and resettle in the villages of Nagré, Taagu and Natiaboani, thanks to the dialogue and consultation initiated by the OCADES/CCRGS between the authorities and local community leaders.
**Significance of the outcome**: Previously, the FDS of Natiaboani, who were supposed to ensure the security of the population and the communication routes between the villages and Fada, had remained entrenched in their camp. As a result, people were unable to leave the villages, and those who were already in Fada were unable to return home to stock up on supplies, having forcibly abandoned their resources (food, poultry, cattle, goats, clothing) to go to the town of Fada. Protecting the population and securing the roads were essential to enable the people of these localities to live in their communities and move around without the risk of abduction, assassination or attack by armed terrorist groups. The consultation and advocacy work carried out by OCADES/CCRGS led the region's administrative and military authorities to take the necessary security decisions.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Terrorist attacks, targeted kidnappings and threats in various localities led the people of Tanwalbougou and Nagré to flee their communities. Armed terrorist groups had taken control of the roads and surrounded the villages. Many people fled their communities out of fear and sought refuge, especially in the town of Fada. Given the difficulties of living in the sites hosting internally displaced persons, many people had expressed their desire to return to their villages, but were unable to do so because of the lack of protection and security on the roads and inside the villages.

**Contribution of the programme**: The OCADES/CCRGS consortium organised a community dialogue workshop between the FDS and the religious and customary leaders of Tanwalbougou and Nagré in the commune of Fada on 12 October 2022. On 27 and 28 October 2022 in Fada, awareness-raising sessions were held on civil-DSF cooperation in a context of insecurity, as well as a celebration of Community Day. These exchanges enabled participants to improve their knowledge of respect for human rights in situations of insecurity and, above all, to clear up certain misunderstandings in order to strengthen cooperation between the civilian population and the FDS.  In addition, between 17 May and 6 June 2022, a series of courtesy and advocacy visits were made to the Governor (17 May), the High Commissioner (18 May), the Regional Director of the National Police (23 May), the Public Prosecutor (24 May), the army chief of staff (24 May), the Prefect (25 May) and the commander of the regional gendarmerie group (6 June) to discuss protection and support measures for people wishing to return voluntarily to their villages. At all these meetings, each of the authorities undertook to support the process and the objectives of the project.
