**FragmentID**: SCC-SSU2305/CIV039
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: In July 2021, the youth in Juba formed the South Sudan Youth Constitution Review Working group to advocate for youth participation and civic space in the permanent constitution making process of South Sudan.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before this group was formed, there was lack of an all-inclusive youth body. The youth were not organized to actively participate in the implementation of the Chapter VI of the peace agreement in South Sudan.  The formation of the group is important because when youth participate in the constitution making process, their rights and demands are more likely to be included.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Initially, South Sudan Youth Constitution Review Working Group was known as the 35 Constitution Review Activists. But in 2022, the members of the group increased to over 45 (20 females, 25 males), hence the change of name. Currently, the group is headed by a female coordinator.
