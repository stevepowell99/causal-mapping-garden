**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On 9 October 2023 & 22nd January 2024, the Council of the European Union adopted a new sanctions framework to impose sanctions against entities undermining the stability and political transition of Sudan. (RSF & SAF aligned entities)
**Significance of the outcome**: This is a significant outcome for the Sudan SCC programme because part of our work is to support evidence based research on how the military actors engaged in the war in Sudan have captured the economy through the monopoly of the various sectors, especially gold, and how this is aiding the war. The idea is for this work to support any redress efforts or targeted sanctions

**Contribution of the programme**: In September 2023 Mr Baldo from STPT conducted advocacy visits in the Netherlands and Brussels in partnership with PAX to discuss the issues of state capture, sanctions, and the war in Sudan. They met various stakeholders including the Dutch MoFA team that included the new Ambassador to Sudan, the sanctions unit, and other members working on the Sudan on the 7th of September. In Brussels, they also met various officials from the EU such as Thomas Feige (team lead economic Development) and Elizabeth Rouset (Head of cooperation) on the 11th of September. On the 12th he met with officials from the External Action Service (EEAS) of the European Union. On the same day, he attended a technical briefing on sanctions in Sudan with the EU Africa Working Group (COAFR). Present were representatives from Slovenia, Denmark, Germany, Ireland, Finland, Portugal and Italy. on the 13th of September, he met with European Union special representative EUSR for the Horn of Africa David Korpela. On the same day, he also met with the EU Department for International Partnerships (DG INTPA) representatives Victoria Guillen and Piotr Zoporowski. In the meetings in Brussels, NL & US they found their interlocutors to be quite interested in the issue of sanctions and how this policy could be used to hasten an end to the war. We don't have an inside view of the decision-making process that would allow us to establish our role with certainty, however, it seems likely that given our interactions with policymakers and their subsequent actions, that we had a significant impact. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes of course, organisations like Clingendael and C4DS have been instrumental also from the INGO in advocating for these targeted sanctions
