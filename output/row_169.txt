**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: The President of the Republic decided to ask the Minister of Justice to release lawyer Sandra Ndayizeye from Mpimba central prison on October 7, 2022. She had been arrested on September 28, 2022 because of her profession as a lawyer and her involvement in a specific case. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The release showed that the President and high government officials are susceptible to public pressure. This case reached the President and his wife notably since the lawyer is a daughter of a former President and the information about the plan to poison her created public outcry. The  release had an impact on the whole population so that they would continue to denounce such cases and put pressure on local authorities, as that could reach farther than they would think.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The arrest of lawyer Sandra Ndayizeye was intended to prevent her from defending her client, Dr Christophe Sahabo, an entrepreneur doctor and director of Kira Hospital, a reference hospital in Burundi coveted by certain high authorities in the country. On October 2, 2022, FOCODE was informed by a secret service agent that a plan to poison Sandra Ndayizeye was in progress. FOCODE alerted her father, former President Ndayizeye, RPA radio and the president of CAVIB. This created a mobilization that enabled her release. The alert received by FOCODE and shared with several actors created such mobilization that the Burundian authorities agreed to negotiate the release of Sandra Ndayizeye. In addition to sharing information, FOCODE was very active on social networks (twitter and facebook) to mobilize national and international opinion.
