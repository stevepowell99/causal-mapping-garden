**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Community conflicts based on ethnic stigmatisation have been reduced thanks to the involvement of political, religious and economic leaders and the messages they have sent out following the actions of the OCADES/CCRGS consortium between October 2021 and December 2022.
**Significance of the outcome**: With the conflicts linked to the security crisis, ethnic and religious stigmatisation has increased. Analysis of the regional context shows that there is a great deal of mistrust between ethnic and religious communities. In terms of ethnic stigmatisation, one community (the Peuhl) is the most stigmatised, as many citizens equate the Peuhls with terrorists. The involvement of religious and customary leaders is necessary to prevent crises and restore peace. This is why the OCADES/CCRGS consortium has worked to mobilise the religious and customary leaders of Tanwalbougou and Nagré to prevent and reduce cases of stigmatisation based on religion, ethnicity and social status in these localities. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: As a result of the terrorist attacks, which led to a crisis of confidence, particularly with regard to the Peulh ethnic group, all the Peulh had to flee Tanwalbougou and Nagare to save their lives. The aim of the consultation and dialogue initiatives, including the rapprochement (reconciliation) between communities, was to restore social cohesion and understanding between ethnic groups and religions in the East region.

**Contribution of the programme**: Following the actions carried out with political leaders in 2021, the OCADES/CCRGS consortium organised a series of activities to combat ethnic and religious stigmatisation in the East region during 2022. Two dialogue and reflection workshops (held on 6 and 26 October 2022 respectively) helped to diagnose the causes and consequences of the security crisis, which are aggravating cases of stigmatisation and the lack of cooperation between civilians and the military. They also made it possible to propose endogenous, consensual and accepted solutions to enable the population to return safely to their villages. Focus groups or discussion groups were then held from 6 to 9 September 2022. An ethnic forum called ‘community day’, where each community demonstrated the values of its culture to the others, was held on 22 October in Fada. An interactive radio programme was then broadcast on 15 October 2022 with contributions from religious and traditional leaders on peaceful cohabitation between ethnic groups.  With a view to improving collaboration between civilians and the military, the OCADES/CCRGS consortium organised awareness-raising sessions on 27 and 28 October 2022 in Fada on civil-FDS collaboration in a context of insecurity. These exchanges enabled participants to improve their knowledge of respect for human rights in situations of insecurity and, above all, to clear up certain misunderstandings in order to strengthen cooperation between the civilian population and the security forces (FDS). Finally, on 12 October 2022, the project organised a community dialogue between the FDS, religious leaders, administrative authorities and representatives of the ethnic groups in the two villages of Nagré and Tanwalbougou.
