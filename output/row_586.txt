**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: On March 5th, 2025, the American University of Beirut’s Center for Civic Engagement and Community Services held an event titled “Breaking the Cycle of Violence Together” to mark International Women’s Day. The event focused on gender-based violence during times of conflict and featured national and international organizations, including Abaad.
**Significance of the outcome**: The event created a platform within a prestigious academic institution to highlight the often-overlooked forms of violence against women in emergencies and conflict settings. It not only raised awareness among students but also fostered connections between youth and key actors in the gender equality space. By centering the conversation on under-reported forms of violence, the event helped challenge silence and stigma, empowering a new generation to recognize and engage with GBV prevention and response. This outcome reflects a significant shift in student engagement with gender-based violence issues. The students not only selected a critical, under-discussed topic, GBV during conflic, but also facilitated a high-level dialogue open to the broader university community. The event addressed the lack of visibility around violence against women in emergencies and promoted multisectoral responses by connecting students with NGOs. As an initiative led by youth within a major academic institution, it signals growing awareness, agency, and leadership among young people in GBV advocacy.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The event, which was open and attended by members of the larger student body at the American University of Beirut, discussed the breadth of forms of discrimination and violence against women, with a special emphasis on how types of violence against women and frequency increase during times of war. The event sought to raise the awareness of this under-reported and under-discussed issue, which further marginalizes survivors of violence. This event presented the initiatives that are being taken to address this issue. The importance of interventions and policies empowering women to be free from gender-based violence in their lives, as well as initiatives working on militarism and engaging men to end violence against women, were also offered to those in attendance. Through this event, the students were given the opportunity to be better acquainted with several national Non-Governmental Organizations working on the issue, such as Abaad: Resource center for gender equality, and international actors who have a presence in Lebanon, such as Becky’s Button. The event was open to the entire student body as a way of introducing rand familiarizing the larger student body with the existence and mission of the American University of Beirut Center for Civic Engagement and Community Services
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: Civic change agents
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: The students were directly influenced by Abaad’s “Assault Does Not Justify Assault” campaign, launched during the 16 Days of Activism in late 2024. The campaign’s emphasis on maintaining focus on GBV even amid war and crisis inspired the students to adopt the issue for their March 2025 event. In addition to shaping the topic, the campaign motivated the students to involve Abaad as a speaker, reinforcing the link between advocacy messaging and action. Without the campaign, this specific outcome would likely not have taken shape.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, the students were already planning an event, but after ABAAD 16 days of activism campaign, they shifted the event topic and objective
