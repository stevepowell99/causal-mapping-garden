**Outcome description**: In November 2021, the Colombian subsidiary of Glencore (Prodeco) published its Human Rights Impact Assessment on its operations in the César mining region (this was something that the victims of human rights violations in this region had been asking for for a long time).
**Significance of the outcome**: One of the central asks of the representatives of the victims to the company is for the company to engage in a formal dialogue with the victims regarding the human rights impacts of the company's coal mining activities in the context of the violent conflict in the early 2000s. The publication of the HRIA (with information on the company's assessment and contribution to negative human rights impact) is an important condition for such a dialogue to be effective.
