**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: 5 October 2023, the governor of the East region issued a decree adopting the regional strategy for strengthening social cohesion and consolidating peace (SRCCP) 2023-2027 and its action plan. This strategy was validated in June 2023 by the driving forces of the East region.
**Significance of the outcome**: Since 2015, Burkina Faso has seen its social peace deteriorate with the recurrence of terrorist attacks that claim many lives every day. This situation has contributed to the erosion of social cohesion in many parts of the country. This has led the government of Burkina Faso to include social cohesion in its national development policy. To this end, a National Strategy for Social Cohesion (SNCS) was drawn up and validated in July 2021. On the basis of the SNCS and the awareness-raising activities of NGOs, the East region has adopted a Regional Strategy to Strengthen Social Cohesion and Consolidate Peace (SRCCP). The development of this strategy reflects the determination of the region's authorities, and by extension that of OCADES, to place social cohesion at the centre of their concerns with a view to building a united, prosperous and supportive regional community. OCADES' participation in the development of this strategy is directly in line with one of these objectives, which is to build more inclusive and peaceful communities in the Eastern region.
