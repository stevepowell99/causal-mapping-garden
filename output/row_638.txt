**Outcome description**: In June 2025, members of two large families (the OUEDRAOGO families) comprising around 50 people were reconciled after five years of land disputes in Sector 9 of Ouahigouya in northern Burkina Faso.
**Significance of the outcome**: Since 2021, the family of Ouédraogo Salif had been in conflict with that of Ouédraogo Saidou, known as Ladji Net, over a family inheritance linked to land. Since then, members of these families had not spoken to each other or seen each other. A climate of mistrust and disagreement that could have degenerated into open confrontation prevailed between the families. The resolution of this conflict is part of the achievement of SDG 2.
