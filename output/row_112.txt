**FragmentID**: SCC-SUD2305/CIV004
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In June 2022 in Kampala, individual (W) HRDs and HRD organisations established the Sudan human rights defenders coalition (SudanDefenders) to maximise safety and protection of (W)HRDs in Sudan. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Before the establishment of the Coalition in Sudan, there was a lack of coordination, limited access to protection mechanisms and a safe platform for (W)HRDs to discuss issues pertinent to them. The Coalition provides tailor made solutions and creates opportunities for (W)HRDs to access protection services, assess AU and UN mechanisms for advocacy and capacity building in security management. Under the project, this is registered as a major breakthrough since the establishment of the Coalition was a pending issue since 2013
**Additional information (use if needed) **: DefendDefenders established the Coalition in 2010 but it was disolved as a result of mismanagement in 2013. In June 2022, DefendDefenders convened a consultation meeting for individual (W)HRDs and HRD organisations in Kampala. A Kampala Declaration was developed and signed to establish SudanDefenders. An interim committee constituting 9 members were elected with women in majority positions.
