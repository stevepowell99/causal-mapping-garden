**FragmentID**: SCC-LEB2305/ESF013
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In 2022, the Belgian government allocated 3 million euros to fund RPW members, ALEF, Basma and Zeitouna, Women Now, and 11.11.11 for a 5-year project ‘Durable Solutions for Syrian refugees in Lebanon’. This project lead to the creation of the triple nexus platform and sustenance of the PASC network. The project is part of the Belgian Directorate-General for Development Cooperation and Humanitarian Aid (DGD) programme which is under the Madad fund.
**Significance of the outcome**: Lebanon is not on the list of Belgian’s priority countries and the budget received is close to what can be categorized as close to direct funding to local and refugee lead organizations. 11.11.11 only receives a small portion of the money for one staff member to do administrative reporting work and the rest of the money goes towards activities. Moreover, the creation of a triple nexus plateform by PASC demonstrates the ability of a ALEF, a Lebanese local organization, to create a structure for local organizations to be in the lead with sufficient space and resources to make changes and think about best practices. They will also be able to form key arguments in broader global discussions in other contexts on potential and future aid specifically with displacement. This outcome supports broader conversations on localization, on how to put a local organization in the driving seat and give them the time and budget to exchange through trial and error.
