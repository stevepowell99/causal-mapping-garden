**Additional information (use if needed) **:  In March 2023, the CGHRD- Kenya was attacked by the government as a result of their mandate that covers Sexual Reproductive and Health Rights, safe abortion, advocating for the rights of sexual minorities. A member of the Coalition and CGHRD were profiled and accussed of allegedly recruiting children into the LGBTIQ movement. The Organisation reached out to DCK, Strategic Issue Research Council (SIRC) and Wellsprings that extended physical support to fill the gaps identified by the audit and improve their office security. However, digital security wasn't addressed yet, while there were increasing online attacks. Later, a recommendation was made to DD by DCK to conduct a digital security audit.
