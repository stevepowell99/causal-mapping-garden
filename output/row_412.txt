**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2312/PHR003
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On 19 October 2023, at the instigation of the National Human Rights Commission of Burundi (CNIDH, Commission Nationale Indépendante des Droits de l'Homme), a week after the prosecutors' order, police commissioner Jacques Nijimbere finally released more than 300 of 700 detainees who had been unjustly imprisoned in inhumane conditions in a former police cell known as the BSR (Bureau Spécial de Recherche). 
**Significance of the outcome**: In September 2023, shocking information was revealed about the living conditions in the police dungeon. More than seven hundred people were being held there, in very difficult conditions. Commissioner Jacques Nijimbere was at the centre of these events, using these inhumane conditions for his own gain. Instead of protecting and serving, the guards inflicted torture and abuse on the detainees, showing a total lack of respect for human dignity.  Following the revelation by one of our partner's informants, the CNIDH, headed by its President Sixte Vigny Nimuraba, went to the site and pleaded for the problem to be resolved. The prosecutors then ordered the release of more than 300 of the 700 detainees. The CNIDH's intervention shows that this not really independent institution can still instigate positive changes to put an end to these serious human rights violations, probably influenced by the public and civil society (and probably because it was not high-level political repression).
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The inmates had no suitable place to sleep and were exposed to the rain directly. The dungeon, which was very small, was divided into six cells, too narrow for the number of inmates, and infested with mosquitoes and cockroaches. These people had to pay the guards for permission to sleep on the floor, showing the extent to which corruption affected even the most basic aspects of their daily lives. This deplorable situation led to several deaths, adding to the seriousness of the problem. The inmates were also suffering from hunger, making their desperate situation even worse. 
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: Through the Ndondeza campaign against enforced disappearances (supported by AINL), FOCODE has built up its reputation in the field of whistleblowing to such an extent that the authorities fear being mentioned in cases of human rights violations. In this case, a committed citizen alerted FOCODE to the situation in the dungeon. He described in detail what he had observed and provided supporting evidence and photos. After verifying this information, FOCODE issued an alert on social networks. This revelation provoked a strong reaction from the public, which was expressed in numerous outraged comments and calls for the relevant authorities to look into the matter. FOCODE also sent a message directly to the CNIDH asking it to intervene quickly. We believe that FOCODE's alert had a multiplier effect, which led to such rapid change.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The population also played a crucial role, acting as a driving force for change by widely sharing their indignation and support through judicious and involved comments on FOCODE's posts and those of its president. This wave of collective action, symbolised by the active participation of citizens, created significant social pressure that probably influenced the authorities' decisions. The commitment didn't stop there: other media and platforms spread the information, pushing it to the top of the news agenda. The resonance of the comments, the sharing and the avalanche of 'likes' considerably amplified the call to action. Of course, we should also mention the role of the CNIDH.
