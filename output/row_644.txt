**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2508/PHR011
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Since June 2025, religious leaders (Muslim, Protestant, traditional and Catholic) in the municipality of Kaya in the Kuilse region of Burkina Faso have come closer together, accepted each other and attended the Tabaski festival together for the first time. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Before 2025, relations between religious denominations in the kingdom of Boussouma were distant, even tense. There was no framework for interfaith collaboration, and Protestant, Catholic and Muslim religious leaders never participated in the festivals or religious activities of other denominations. Each remained confined to their own community, which reinforced prejudices, religious isolation and sometimes underlying tensions. This rapprochement between different religious denominations represents a change in attitudes and practices that breaks with the behaviour of religious communities that have long been characterised by separation, intolerance and mistrust. Achieving dialogue between religions was one of the expected outcomes of the SCC programme.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Following advocacy and outreach efforts by various religious leaders, the President of the FEME (Federation of Missionary and Evangelical Churches) and the parish priest of Kaya Cathedral officially attended Muslim prayers alongside the canton chief on the occasion of the Tabaski festival on 6 June 2025. This is an unprecedented event in the region. This rapprochement between religious leaders, clearly demonstrated by the presence of other faiths at the Tabaski festival, is likely to influence mutual understanding between followers of the different religious denominations in the municipality. The programme has thus contributed to a profound change in attitudes.
**Rating significance**: medium
