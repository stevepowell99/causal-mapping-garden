**Contribution of the programme**: Through the SCC programme, MAAN has worked with a large number of activists from regions across Lebanon and supported them in their activism and initiatives. Through the network they have created, MAAN developed a needs assessment with the youth activists and discovered that one weakness they identified in their ability to build a stronger movement is the lack of digital safe spaces for them to coordinate their movement and actions. This happened especially after the manipulation of the security forces of the social media and digital platform activists have on their phones. MAAN identified the need of a safe digital platform for communication, so the Beehive app was created to help the activists of DAA coordinate and work safely towards their goals, and providing a more inclusive and safe (online) space for them to work
