**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In July 2025, the Community Action Centre (CAC) participated for the first time in the Hague Group High-Level Conference in Bogotá, Colombia, following an invitation from the Co-Chair of the Hague Group, Colombia, through the Vice Minister for Multilateral Affairs. This marked CAC’s entry into a new diplomatic space, engaging directly with Global South states and high-level representatives on international legal accountability and multilateral action.
**Significance of the outcome**: It demonstrates CAC’s transformation from a locally focused organization into a credible international actor influencing high-level diplomatic processes. Their participation in the Bogotá Conference placed them at the heart of a historic Global South-led initiative for Palestinian justice. The Hague Group has emerged as a powerful diplomatic bloc, and CAC’s inclusion in its processes reflects the growing recognition of Palestinian civil society in shaping international legal and political responses. Moreover, CAC’s intervention and presence at the conference were not only symbolic but strategic: they contributed legal tools and advocacy framing that supported participating states in strengthening their international interventions
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The Hague Group, formed on January 31, 2025, is a coalition of Global South countries leading a state-driven initiative to end Israel’s genocide in Gaza and ensure compliance with international law. Its work is grounded in the International Court of Justice Advisory Opinion of July 19, 2024, and UN General Assembly Resolution A/RES/ES 10/24. CAC’s invitation to the Bogotá conference was facilitated through networks established during the project, particularly its collaboration with Law4Palestine and its partnership with Amnesty Netherlands. The conference brought together legal experts and high-level state representatives and concluded with the adoption of the Hague Declaration, outlining six concrete steps states will take against Israel.
