**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In November 2022 women in Greater Kapoeta invited local youths to participate in a peace dialogue meeting held to resolve cattle raiding, road robbery, revenge killing of innocent women and children that always raise more tension amongst conflicting communities of Didinga, Buya, Toposa locals and political tribalism.
**Significance of the outcome**: In the past women groups of different ethnic backgrounds did not come together. They would look at each other with fear, due to cattle-raiding and conflicts. The women started to reconcile during the POV monthly fora, discussed issues together and jointly reached out to youth who are involved in cattle-raiding, crimes and violence. This had never happened before. As a result of this the youth accepted to reduce and stop their negative behaviour.
