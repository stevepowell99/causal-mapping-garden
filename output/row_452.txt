**FragmentID**: SCC-IRQ2312/GEQ002
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In December 2024 in Mosul, Brigadier General Abdul Razzaq Al-Khafaji, former advisor to the Nineveh Operations Command and currently advisor to the Ministry of Defense, stated that he will establish a special club that supports the talents of women and girls with special needs in Mosul.
**Significance of the outcome**: In Iraqi society and its governmental institutions, women and girls with special needs are often overlooked and deemed a financial and social burden. This demographic group is rarely recognized for their potential to contribute productively. This issue is even more pronounced for female survivors of human rights abuses with special needs, who face compounded discrimination. Such intersectional discrimination leads to further marginalization of an already vulnerable group, a fact highlighted by the gender and conflict analysis conducted by PFO in 2022. By addressing this issue and empowering this marginalized group, Brigadier Abdul Razzak is challenging prevailing stereotypes. His actions are a significant step towards their rightful integration into society and a move towards rectifying the injustices they have endured.
