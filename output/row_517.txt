**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: During the war on Lebanon at the end of 2024, all 3 partners have strategically adapted their intervention strategies to respond to the emergency needs on the ground across Lebanon (in all four)
**Significance of the outcome**: Before the Israeli genocide in Gaza and the war on Lebanon in 2024, there was of course no need to adapt strategies to urgent and emergency needs on the ground. The violence inflicted by Israel led to huge numbers of displaced people across the country, sharp increase in poverty, increases in SGBV, and urgent physical and psychosocial health needs. The political deadlock in the country meant the government was not able to adequately respond so NGOs and CSOs filled that gap. It is signficant as it shows partners adaptability and resilience in times of crisis. Partners showed that in times of crisis and urgent needs, they are able to adapt their activities to meet the needs within their communities. Part of being conflict-sensitive and the Do No Harm approach means responding to these events in the most contextually-relevant and needed way which all partners did.
