**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2312/PHR007
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On 22 July 2023, Malian authorities responded positively to the urgent appeals of civil society organisations (CSOs) by including a commitment to respect the rights of women, children and people living with disabilities in the preamble to the new constitution
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to this constitutional development, the context in Mali showed significant gaps in the protection of the rights of women, children and people living with disabilities, with persistent levels of violence not adequately addressed by existing legislation. This breakthrough is of key importance to the objectives of the TRIJEUD, as it establishes a strengthened legal framework, marked by an explicit commitment to respect for the fundamental rights of vulnerable groups. By addressing previous shortcomings, this development is a cornerstone in the fight against all forms of violence, providing substantial support for the realisation of the aspirations of human rights defenders for the protection and empowerment of these vulnerable populations.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The constitutional review in Mali has proved important in introducing innovative provisions that specifically strengthen the protection of the rights of women, children and people living with disabilities. These inclusive measures demonstrate a concrete commitment to gender equality and social inclusion, promoting a holistic approach in the fight against discrimination and systemic violence.
**Rating significance**: early/small
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: Through the organisation of a workshop to reflect on the draft constitution, followed by a press briefing, involving some thirty CSOs, including Trijeud-Mali, observations were shared with national opinion. This initiative contributed significantly to the positive response of the Malian authorities to the pressing appeals of CSOs, resulting in the formal integration of changes in the preamble of the new constitution, reinforcing the commitment to the rights of women, children and people living with disabilities.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Lawyers Without Borders Canada (LWBC) played a key role in achieving this goal. As a non-SCC organisation, it actively contributed as the organiser of the reflection workshop in collaboration with numerous partners at national level, including Trijeud-Mali. Their strategic involvement in the planning and implementation of the workshop strengthened the impact of the initiative, facilitating collaboration between CSOs and positively influencing the response of the Malian authorities, leading to the inclusion of the changes in the preamble to the new constitution.
