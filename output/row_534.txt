**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In June 2025, following a discussion with  CAC, the UN Commission of Inquiry (COI) on the Occupied Palestinian Territory (Navi Pillay (Chair) and Chris Sidoti) agreed to re-evaluate its analysis of the root causes of recurring tension and instability between the Jordan River and the Mediterranean Sea. The commissioners expressed openness to revisiting their position and, in subsequent communication, indicated their intention to publish a revised framework in October 2025. 
**Significance of the outcome**: This outcome is highly significant as it represents a potential paradigm shift in how the UN’s highest investigative body on Palestine frames the root causes of the conflict. If the revised framework includes a recognition of Zionism as a structural root cause, it would mark a historic acknowledgment within the UN system, one that could reshape international legal and political discourse on Palestine. CAC’s ability to influence this shift demonstrates the growing credibility and strategic impact of Palestinian civil society actors in high-level international mechanisms.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In its initial reports, the COI identified two primary root causes: the prolonged occupation and a climate of impunity. CAC, along with other NGOs, consistently challenged this framing, arguing that it failed to address Zionism as a root cause. For a period, the dialogue with the COI’s staff appeared stalled. However, CAC succeeded in securing a direct meeting with the commissioners themselves. During this meeting, CAC emphasized the analytical gap in the COI’s framing and advocated for a more accurate and historically grounded understanding of the root causes. The commissioners’ subsequent openness to revisiting their analysis marks a significant shift. Confirmation of their intent to publish a revised framework came via a phone call with Giuseppe Calandruccio, Head of Staff for the COI.
