**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2305/PHR005
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: The Minister of Justice ordered the release of Angela Nicimpaye, a very sick 82-year-old woman, from Mpimba Central Prison on October 18, 2022 thanks to communication from a partner organisation.
**Significance of the outcome**: The release of the old lady shows that the government is susceptible to public pressure, which followed after the partner organisation published details about the victim and the case. What may have also helped is that Angela was the mother of an old combattant of the FDD who was killed during the war, which made certain generals in the current army and party cadres put pressure on the Minister of Justice to release her. Like other releases, this release had an impact on the whole population so that they would continue to denounce such cases and put pressure on local authorities, as that could reach farther than they would think.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Angela Nicimpaye was arrested on October 18, 2021. A few young Imbonerakure militiamen were caught consuming hemp in front of her house. Without proof, Angela was accused of having sold the hemp to these young people. She was sentenced to two years in prison and the payment of a fine of 100 dollars, whereas, for minor infractions, Burundian law does not authorize the imprisonment of the very old and those suffering from chronic illnesses.
