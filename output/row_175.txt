**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In Geneva in August 2022 Dutch and other EU government officials elaborated during an ATT side event how they assessed risks of transferring weapons to Ukraine, in light of the war and risk of diversion. Until then, for eight years, besides individual exceptions, discussions on risk assessments by governement officials for concrete cases had not happened during (margins of) ATT meetings. 
**Significance of the outcome**: For years, civil sociey has argued and advocated that for the ATT to be meaningful, it is neccessary to have open discussions on concrete cases, to improve common understanding of mitigating risks, and to have proper discussions on how risks may be perceived differently. Therefore, after so many years of refusing so, this discussion on Ukraine is a meaningful first step to have more such discussions.
