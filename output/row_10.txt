**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2021
**Outcome description**: Since 2021, discrimination and stigmatization against the Peulh have been reduced thanks to the mechanisms and forums for dialogue created by the RAJS and PAX. between Mosse and Peulh chiefs.
**Significance of the outcome**: With the exacerbation of the security situation, the Peulh community is a stigmatised ethnic group, generally indexed as radicals and extremists or accomplices of armed terrorist groups. The Peulh were very often chased from their homes or lands by self-defence groups such as the Koogkéogo, made up mainly of Mosse. The involvement and rapprochement of the traditional Moose and Peulh chiefs were essential for a return to peace and the prevention of community conflicts. Thanks to the dialogue forums set up by the RAJS and PAX between the traditional Mosse and Peulh chiefs of the twelve (12) cantons of Boussouma, it has been possible to reduce cases of stigmatisation of the Peulh and above all to prevent community conflicts.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The killings of the Mosse and Peulh of Yirgou (a village located in the north-central region of Burkina Faso) led to a climate of great insecurity and, above all, the stigmatisation of the Peulh. Many Fulani were forced to flee their territories because of the murders and other targeted killings directed against them. The dialogue between traditional Moose and Peulh chiefs has made it possible to diagnose the concerns of each community and to find endogenous solutions to prevent and manage conflicts. In November 2021, the chief of Sanmatenga obtained the return of the Peulh to their land in the village of Nongo, which had been occupied by the Mosse, thanks to the dialogues and consultations held.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Non-state authorities
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: In September 2021, the RAJS, a PAX partner, made individual contact with the chiefs and then initiated private focus groups by entity (between chiefs from the same community) to discuss the problems they were experiencing and propose recommendations.  At the end of these focus groups, a global consultation framework was held to share the results of the focus group work in October 2021. It was during these meetings that collaboration links were forged between Mossé and Peulh chiefs. This work, which proved satisfactory, enabled all 12 cantons in the kingdom of Boussouma to be mobilised in July 2022 for a joint synergy, in particular the capacity-building workshop held on 5 and 7 July 2022. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The only contribution to this outcome was made by RAJS, a PAX partner.
