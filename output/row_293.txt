**FragmentID**: SCC-INT2312/ESF023
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In August 2023, a representative of the victims of war crimes in Block 5A in Sudan engaged in dialogue with representatives of Aker BP, a Norwegian oil company that merged with (and thus absorbed) Lundin Energy (the company that contributed to war crimes and severe human rights violations during the oil wars in Sudan and whose former executives are currently standing trial for aiding and abetting these crimes).
**Significance of the outcome**: The outcome was significant in the sense that it was the first time that a representative of the victims engaged in direct dialogue with the company (now) (co-)responsible for remediating the adverse impacts in Block 5A, expressing the grievances and directly voicing the ask of the victims towards this company.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The dialogue was part of a mediation process offered by the Norwegian National Contact Point for the OECD Guidelines, after PAX, together with 7 other European and South Sudanese civil society organisations (including victims' organisations) filed a complaint with this NCP against Aker BP for failing its responsibilities under the OECD Guidelines and contributing to an adverse impact, namely the perpetuation of the ongoing denial of remedy to the victims. The mediation failed to lead to a joint agreement, so the Norwegian NCP will now publish an independent final assessment of the issues raised in the complaint.
