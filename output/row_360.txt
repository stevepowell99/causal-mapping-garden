**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In August 2023, Ouédraogo Mariam, a Muslim heroine, washed and dressed the body of a Catholic woman named Ouédraogo Adèle (sector 12 Gondologo, Ouahigouya/Yatenga province/Northern region of Burkina Faso) who had died in Ouahigouya hospital, following a request from the family of the deceased, including her mother, Ouédraogo Brigitte. Previously, Ouédraogo Mariam, a Muslim, had never washed the body of a non-Muslim according to Islamic practices.
**Significance of the outcome**: The northern region of Burkina Faso has a Muslim majority. According to Islamic practice in the north, Muslims must not touch the body of a non-Muslim. Ouédraogo Mariam has been asked to wash bodies for over 20 years, and this is the first time she has done so for a non-Muslim. It's an important effect because it's in line with one of our objectives, which is the culture of peace through religious tolerance, and our general objective, which is the prevention of radicalisation and violent extremism through the actions of women and men leaders in the northern region

**Contribution of the programme**: At Ouahigouya hospital, the heroine Ouédraogo Mariam went to wash the body of one of her relatives who had died. Afterwards, the family of the late Ouédraogo Adèle, who is Catholic, asked for Ouédraogo Mariam's services because none of the women present knew anything about it. So, in the name of the peace and social cohesion promoted by our project, of which Mariam is the hero, she accepted, even though she only washed the bodies of Muslim women. The contribution is direct: because it is the overall fact of the project, i.e. the fact that Ouédraogo Mariam is a hero, that has favoured this effectThe contribution is small: It's just one person who has changed. The vast majority of Muslims remain with their ideas.The change is positive and intentional 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: No No other actor contributed to achieving the effect. This action was taken by the heroine Ouédraogo Mariam, who was directly involved in the project.
