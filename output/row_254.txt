**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In June of 2023, Hossam Iskandar, a young Shabak man with special needs, requested and was successfully awarded a referral letter from the director of the Disability and Special Needs Department in Ninewa for his master's degree application. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Many people with disabilities belonging to minority groups, particularly within the Shabak community, remain unaware of their rights, stemming from a deep-seated intergenerational mistrust in the Iraqi national legal framework. This skepticism towards Iraqi legislation and governmental practices has left many unaware of the legal provisions designed to benefit people with disabilities and special needs, especially those included in the new survivor's law. One such provision includes preferential treatment for people with disabilities in higher education applications. This lack of confidence, more pronounced among minority groups, has contributed to the exclusion of vulnerable members of the Shabak community from mechanisms of transitional justice. This outcome, brokered by the project's holistic and inclusive approaches, sets a precedent for marginalized community members to pursue their rights within the existing transitional justice frameworks.

**Contribution of the programme**: In second week of June 2023, a project-funded CBO in Bashiqa (originally the Bashiqa local peace committee established in the previous DRL-funded project in Ninewa) organized several town hall meeting sessions on the rights of people with disabilities, attended both by the director of the disability and special needs department and by Hossam Iskandar. Adopting an inclusive and Human-centered approach, the CBO appointed people with disabilities to lead and facilitate the meetings. Engaging representatives of marginalized communities in activities at a leadership level has been key to ensuring greater access to justice mechanisms for the most marginalized groups of Ninewa's society.
