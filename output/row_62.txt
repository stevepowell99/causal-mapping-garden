**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Since February 2022, after trauma healing sessions/awareness, members of the armed forces in military barracks of Kit Gwang, Upper Nile State, are now promoting social relationships among themselves and with the civil community.
**Significance of the outcome**: Kit Gwang is a fraction from IO dominated by Shiluk, located in the Northern part of Upper Nile bordering Sudan. This is a closed region, where not many people go to. CDOM was requested by a medical doctor – who is also a commandor in the army - to conduct a trauma-healing session in this region as there is a high rate of suicide among the soldiers. In the past soldiers were living ‘on themselves’ dealing with their own stress. During the training the soldiers showed great interest and happiness. After the trauma healing session they started sharing their struggles and stress, they started laughing and the suicide rates reduced.
