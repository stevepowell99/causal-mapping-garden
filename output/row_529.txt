**Outcome description**: Between January and July 2025, civil society activists and lawyers in Canada engaged with PAX and wrote publicly about human rights violations at DRC's Kibali gold mine which PAX documented in its December 2024 "Giant Evictions, Giant Profits" report.
**Significance of the outcome**: PAX published a report on human rights abuses at the Kibali goldmine (co-owned and operated by the Canada based enterprise Barrick) in the DRC in December 2024. This was the first public human rights report by an international NGO on Kibali since PAX published "Le Géant minier Kibali" almost a decade earlier, in 2015.

PAX’s report helped sparking interest and gave them facts about the Kibali case.
