**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Syria
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In November 2024, a group of non-violent activists originating from various governorates in Syria, working together within a network named Sullam for non violence, collaboratively designed a 2 years strategy to promote non-violence across Syria.
**Significance of the outcome**: PAX has been connected to non-violent activists in the last years providing them opportunities to study at AUNOHR. However they were not connected and worked independently from each other. By launching a project currently funded by the EU and co-funded by PAX/SCC, PAX provided opportunities for non-violent activists to come together and form a network, foreseeing to work together hand in hand in order to promote non-violence in Syria. Activists came together through virtual and physical meetings in order to formulate a common vision and mission and design a strategy that they will seek to implement during the coming two years.
