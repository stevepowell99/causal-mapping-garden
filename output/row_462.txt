**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: International / External Stress Factors
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In November 2024, in the run-up to the public consultations on the new Dutch due diligence legislation (WIVO), the Dutch government informally indicated to the MVO platform that they were planning to include explicit references to conflict-sensitive due diligence in the text.
**Significance of the outcome**: 1) After the entry into force of the CSDDD in July 2024, the EU member states were given two years to transpose this Directive into national level legislation. In the Netherlands, the government started working on the WIVO, public consultations ran from november to december 2024. During these consultations, the government indicated to the MVO platform that they were planning to include references to conflict sensitive due diligence in the text of the Dutch legislation. 2) This is significant because in conflict-affected and high risk areas, businesses run a high risk of becoming involved with severe human rights abuses. Companies therefore need to conduct 'heightened' or conflict-sensitive human rights due diligence on all their activities and business relationships in these areas. PAX and others advocated for this requirement to be included in mandatory due diligence legislation, both on the EU level as well as in the Netherlands.

**Contribution of the programme**: PAX had multiple meetings with the Dutch MFA on the need to include references to the heightened risks in conflict-affected areas and conflict-sensitive due diligence in the EU and national due diligence laws. The MVO platform, of which PAX is a member, also included these points in their broader advocacy and engagement with the MFA. 
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, the MVO platform and the WO=MEN coalition included our messages in their broader advocacy on the CSDDD and the Dutch legislation.
