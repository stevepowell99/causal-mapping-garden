**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In April 2023, the United Nations Human Rights Council (HRC) renewed the mandate of the UN Commission on Human Rights in South Sudan (CHRSS) following advocacy and lobby engagements with various human rights stakeholders before and during the 52nd HRC session in Geneva.
**Significance of the outcome**: The current context in South Sudan is that of a repressive civic space perpetuating a cycle of human rights violations by state actors. The mandate of the CHRSS is important as it plays a vital role in collecting and preserving evidence of violations which can be used for future violations.
