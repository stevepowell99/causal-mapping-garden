**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Palestine
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: On July 16, 2025, the Hague Group adopted the Hague Declaration at the conclusion of its high-level conference in Bogotá, Colombia. The declaration included six concrete measures against Israel, several of which directly reflected the legal and strategic recommendations presented by the Community Action Centre (CAC) during an expert briefing on July 14, 2025. These included calls for the establishment of a redress mechanism, the reconstitution of the UN Committee Against Apartheid, and the convening of a "Uniting for Peace" session at the UN General Assembly.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before this collaboration, there was no unified or concrete roadmap among Global South states for implementing the ICJ Advisory Opinion or the UN General Assembly resolution regarding Israel’s occupation and actions in Gaza. The Hague Group was still in its formative stages, and its direction was not yet clearly defined. This outcome is significant because it demonstrates that CAC’s legal advocacy directly influenced state-level decision-making. The inclusion of CAC’s recommendations in the Hague Declaration shows that civil society can shape international legal and diplomatic agendas, advancing CAC’s mission to promote accountability and justice through multilateral mechanisms.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The intervention was part of a coordinated effort by nine CSOs to ensure complementarity and avoid duplication. CAC’s focus on multilateralism and legal mechanisms complemented other thematic areas, enhancing the overall impact of the briefing. The presence of ambassadors from Qatar, Indonesia, Mexico, and Malaysia further amplified the visibility and potential uptake of the recommendations.
