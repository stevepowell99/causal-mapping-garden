**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In Mali in 2023, after being requested by the Public Prosecutor at the Mopti Court of Appeal, during the work of the first ordinary session of the Mopti Court of Assizes held from 23 October to 03 November 2023, TRIJEUD was able to provide legal counsel and support to 5 victims of abuse and violations, including three cases of paedophilia, one case of rape and one case of murder, during the October 2023 session of the Mopti Court of Assizes
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to the TRIJEUD's intervention, victims were faced with a lack of adequate legal support, which often left them without recourse before the courts, especially in cases as sensitive as paedophilia and rape, which constitute GBV. TRIJEUD's intervention not only ensured legal representation for the victims, but also reinforced the objectives of SCC's programme by promoting access to justice and fighting impunity for survivors of GBV and human rights abuses.
