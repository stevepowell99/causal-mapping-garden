**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Kenya
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: Following the training in strategic advocacy and communications in July 2023, the Kenyan police is collaborating with Mukuru social justice center to reduce arbitrary arrests, extra judicial killings, corruption and extortion by the security agencies in Mukuru kwa Reuben
**Significance of the outcome**: There was a forceful eviction of over 20,000 slum dwellers in Mukuru slums in March 2022. This was followed up with several protests, excess use of force leading to injury, death and arrest of several protesters. Since then, youth have experienced repeated incidents of use of excessive force by the police, arbitrary arrests and detention of HRDs, extortion and corruption tendences by the police. Several cases of extra judicial killings have also been reported. While there is enhanced collaboration between the NPS and the local SJC, attacks, harassment and intimidation of vocal  HRDs is prevalent and Defenders Coalition continues to support them.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The Social Justice Center in Mukuru kwa Reuben was for a long time documenting cases of violations. During the eviction, the SJC office was demolished. The national government provided a space to temporarily host the SJC. International Justice Mission (IJM) supported by securing a container for a new office space, and DCK provided office equipment. In 2023, after the training in strategic advocacy and communication, SJC started engaging in advocacy with the police and other security agencies to reduce excessive use of force, stop arbitrary arrests, detention and extra judicial killings. With the evidence documented for advocacy, the Directorate of Public Prosecution (DPP) and the Independent Policing and Oversight Authority (IPOA) have been using the information to prosecute perpetrators. Accordingly, prosecution of the leader of the killer cops on Nairobi's informal settlement is ongoing in court. https://www.citizen.digital/news/key-witnesses-testify-as-ex-cop-rashid-ahmeds-murder-trial-begins-n338497
