**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: Between 2024 and 2025, youth activists from different and conflicting political parties engaged in dialogue with each other on controversial issues in West Bekaa and Hasbaya, Lebanon. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Due to the polarization in the alternative groups and parties at the national level there was a lack of dialogue among them, and initiatives have failed to build a bridge. This in fact has a positive correlation to the failure of the movement and that’s why creating this space for smooth constructive dialogue is relevant because it increase the tolerance among opposing sides.
