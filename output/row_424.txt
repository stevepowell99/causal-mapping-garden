**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On October 4th 2023, the Permanent Mission of Pakistan, on behalf of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation, delivered an oral statement under agenda item 7 at the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva, and addressed the illegal transfer of the house of Noura Sub-Laban (a 69-year-old Palestinian woman who lived in her house in Jerusalem’s old city since she was born in 1952) into the hand of the Galitsia Trust (a settler association based in Jerusalem with the objectives of Judaizing East Jerusalem through redeeming the land and the imposition of Jewish ownership over it). 
**Significance of the outcome**: The intervention was essential in the sense that it was meant to bring to the attention of state parties to the council an issue that has not received the attention it merits, the “settling in the hearts” ideology, which refers to the illegal settling in the center of predominantly Palestinian neighborhoods through the dispossession of Palestinian immovable properties; and gender-inclusive and timely, as Noura Sub-Laban, a Palestinian woman, was able to bring her case to the council two months after the dispossession was completed and to represent hundreds of other Palestinian families that had been enduring this abhorrent practice.
