**Outcome description**: In 2022, RPW and the European Institute for Peace were unable to block the adoption of UN's Area-based Return Support Framework (ABRS), but were able to convice the donor community that any return programming needs to have a strong and inclusive monitoring mechanism.  
**Significance of the outcome**: RPW and the European Institute for Peace were instrumental in raising awareness amongst the donor community that were not aware of the existence of this roadmap. Donors are watching UNHCR more carefully. Specifically, the UK, US, and France assured RPW that they are keeping a close eye on UNHCR, and have raised and will continue to raise our concerns. They will also be able to ask informed questions when UNHCR seeks funds for the implementation of ABRS.
