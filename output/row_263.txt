**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In September 2023, senior officials of mining company Barrick Gold, which operates the Kibali mine in Haut-Uélé, organized a two-day meeting at the mine with PAX to discuss allegations of violations of international standards during forced evictions of two villages carried out within its perimeter in October 2021.
**Significance of the outcome**: To the best of PAX's knowledge, Barrick had not met on this subject at such a high level with other NGOs. However, the forced evictions of these two villages, Mege and Bandayi, are serious and require Barrick's involvement to provide solutions for the victims. Previous years' meetings on other subjects with PAX were limited to the country manager level for Kibali; this time, people from the regional level (Africa and Middle East) travelled from South Africa and the UK to take part in this meeting. The fact that Barrick is taking this subject seriously at a higher level and listening to PAX's interventions is the start of a path that will ideally lead to a change in Barrick's behavior on this subject. There are, however, many more steps to be taken.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Barrick invited PAX to the meeting after an exchange of letters between PAX and Barrick's CEO. In the letters, PAX had presented the main findings of its research into forced evictions and posed a series of questions to Barrick. The fact that Barrick's CEO was responding to PAX from 2022 onwards was already a positive first sign.  This was also an opportunity for PAX to re-start the discussion with Barrick about the presence of artisanal miners in its concession and the need for dialogue in this context.
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: Companies
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: PAX first conducted meticulous research, based on numerous interviews, into these forced evictions. PAX then wrote a detailed letter to Barrick's CEO outlining its main findings and asking a series of questions. The quality of the letter, and the fact that PAX announced a forthcoming publication on the same subject, probably prompted Barrick to respond. The contribution is large and direct. It is a positive and intentional change.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: No
**Rating contribution**: great
**The change was unintended**: NO
**Evidence supporting the outcome statement**: Correspondence between PAX and Barrick. Documentation relating to the visit to Kibali in September 2023. Some of these documents are confidential and are available on request from PAX's archives.
