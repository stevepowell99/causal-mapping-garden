**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In May 2025, Azad, a prominent member of the network of advocates who survived extreme torture at the hands of ISIS, participated in a theater production organized by an INGO and perfomed in Mosul, Venice and Vienna, where he shared his story to a very wide audience. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Azad, a survivor of ISIS torture from a rural area in Ninewa, lived in silence with limited space to share his experience or engage in public advocacy. Like many survivors, he faced stigma and lacked opportunities for meaningful participation in peace and justice processes. Azad reported regaining his sense of dignity after sharing his story through the play. The play, which addresses themes of trauma, peace, and resilience, has since been performed in Venice and Vienna summer 2025. This experience empowered Azad to become an international advocate, for peace and gender equality, (after 7 years of exclusion as victim punished by ISIS with insult), using his personal narrative to challenge stereotypes and promote justice on a global stage.  The significance of this change lies in Azad’s transformation into a global peace advocate through storytelling and theatre. His shift from victim to agent of change aligns with the program’s objective of empowering survivors to lead transformative justice efforts and challenge dominant narratives through inclusive, victim-centered approaches.
