**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: DR Congo
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: During a series of operations between July and September 2023, a total of over 157 LRA fighters and dependents (women and children) voluntarily left the bush in Zemio and Mboki (CAR) and laid down their arms to take part in the DDR process.
**Significance of the outcome**: According to our information, these were all the LRA fighters still active in CAR. Coming out of the bush and laying down their arms is the key element in setting the DDR process in motion.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: 
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: Non-state authorities
**Scale**: National
**Contribution of the programme**: PAX and APRu initiated the DDRR process and acted as intermediaries between the Ugandan government and the Central African and Congolese governments on this issue. PAX-APRu's role during the DDRR process included direct contact with LRA groups, confidence-building with LRA groups on a collective and individual level, group profiling (including the issue of child custody), transportation of LRA groups to the disarmament site, support and accompaniment of the demobilized during the demobilization and repatriation process and during the (current) transit period, including the provision of accommodation, food and humanitarian assistance.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes, it was a joint operation, and other players were involved - notably the governments concerned, the Ugandan army and MINUSCA - but only after the impetus provided by PAX and APRu. Clearly, without the action of these two NGOs, the result would not have been achieved.
**Rating contribution**: great
