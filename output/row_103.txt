**Contribution of the programme**: PAX published a policy brief (June 2022) and a joint statement (August 2022) on the importance of including specific obligations for companies active in conflict-affected areas in the EU due diligence legislation. The statement was signed by over 50 civil society organizations and academics and shared broadly with members of the European Parliament and Member State representatives to the Council (the two bodies that need to negotiate on the legislative proposal with the European Commission). We had follow-up conversations with relevant MEPs and we drafted amendments to the legislative proposal. These amendments were then tabled by 3 separate MEPs. The vote in the lead committee (where these amendments are currently being discussed) will take place end of March 2023.
