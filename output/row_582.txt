**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: On 18 March 2025, the Co-chairs' statement in the Brussels IX Conference on the Future of Syria and the Region called for continued support to neighboring countries.
**Significance of the outcome**: In early 2024, some EU Member States were pressuring the European Union to review and declare parts of Syria as safe for return, creating the risk of scaling back financial support to neighbouring host countries like Lebanon. This pressure increased after the political transition in December 2024 with growing narratives that conditions were now adequate for return, despite continued risks and rights violations as reported by RPW and other organizations. The EU’s reaffirmation of its commitment to the principles established since the first Brussels Conference—including the importance of voluntary, safe, dignified and informed return and continued support to host countries—is significant in preventing premature return policies and funding withdrawal to countries hosting large numbers of Syrian refugees including Lebanon.
