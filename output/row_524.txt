**FragmentID**: SCC-LEB2508/CIV002
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In June 2025, a Syrian Alawite newcomer participant formed a relationship with a Lebanese Sunni participant, fostering a sense of safety and promoting social cohesion in Tripoli.
**Significance of the outcome**:  The Lebanese participant helped the newcomer from Syria find a house to rent and assisted her with moving, which led to them becoming neighbors in Tripoli and thus a support to one another. This is significant given the current context of sectarian sensitivities following the Syrian regime’s conflict, where some Lebanese residents, particularly among the Sunni community, are often unwelcoming toward newcomers from Syria, especially Alawites. Despite this, the Lebanese Sunni woman participant offered support and helped secure a safe home next to her own. In a context where mistrust and division are deeply rooted, the bond formed between a Syrian Alawite newcomer and a Lebanese Sunni resident is a powerful indicator of change. It not only reflects personal transformation but also challenges entrenched societal narratives. The fact that the Lebanese participant offered tangible support—helping the newcomer find housing and becoming neighbors—shows a significant level of trust and solidarity. This kind of deep, real-world impact is precisely what the project aims to achieve, making the outcome both highly significant and inspiring for replication
