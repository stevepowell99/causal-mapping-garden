**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Community conflicts over land are reduced thanks to the mechanisms put in place and the role of traditional chiefs as ambassadors for peace between September 2021 and December 2022.
**Significance of the outcome**: Traditional chiefs play a very important role in preventing and resolving conflicts within communities. The educational and motivational activities carried out for chiefs by PAX's partner RAJS have enabled the Mosse and Peulh chiefs to become ambassadors for peace. They play this role by setting a good example, offering advice and mediating in crisis situations.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The awareness-raising activities and coaching provided to the chiefs have enabled them to become agents of change in favour of peace. Some of them did not have these qualities and abilities before. Thanks to the project, one chief gave up his candidacy to be elected deputy to the transitional assembly in March 2022 to avoid a conflict breaking out and because the other chiefs intervened. Other chiefs have also helped to resolve land disputes (allocation of plots of land and demarcation of cattle tracks) through their actions and involvement.
