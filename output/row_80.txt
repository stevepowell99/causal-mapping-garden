**Significance of the outcome**: Before October 2022, there was no platform for community members to express their frustrations on continuous human rights violations and discuss ways to address the problem with the respective authorities. This led to the idea to establish Chief Barazas  where communities can raise their security concerns and request local chiefs to be more proactive in addressing these issues.
