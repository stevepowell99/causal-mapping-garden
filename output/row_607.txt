**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Yemen
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: During the period 2024 –mid 2025, the number of cases legally supported by Mwatana increased significantly  with 1,163 victims of human rights violations receiving support 
**Significance of the outcome**: Within a timespan of 1,5 years, 1,163 victims of human rights violations received legal support. In contrast, prior to the project (pre-October 2023), a total of approx. 3,511 victims had received such support since the beginning of the conflict (2014/2015), so within a timespan of almost 10 years. This increase can be attributed to: -	Improved team capacity following the training. -	Wider field access due to improved coordination mechanisms. -	Escalating needs in conflict-affected areas. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Although exact numbers are not fixed due to the changing nature of fieldwork and conflict dynamics, women were among the most reached groups.
