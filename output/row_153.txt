**FragmentID**: SCC-SAH2305/PHR029
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Sahel/Burkina Faso
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: Civil society actors have increased their visibility and are taking effective action in situations of human rights violations that are increasingly brought to their attention.
**Significance of the outcome**: As a result of the capacity building provided to monitors by local associations and the monitoring work carried out, not only has the visibility of the partners been improved, but above all the monitors are constantly approached by victims or their next of kin with a view to reporting cases of abuse and/or violations. On several occasions, the monitors have been able to secure the release of people who have been arrested and/or detained arbitrarily, thanks to better collaboration with both the judicial and administrative authorities.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Some local organisations did not have the skills to carry out SDR work on the ground, nor were they well known in this field beforehand. 30 cases of kidnapping were reported to the association 'béoog neere soré' (ABNS); ABNS obtained the release of people in 2 cases of arbitrary arrest by working with the prosecutor; RAJS obtained the release of people in 3 cases of illegal detention (1 case at the gendarmerie and 2 cases at the police station) in Kaya; MBDHP obtained the release between January and March 2023 of at least 10 people, including 3 children under the age of 11, after they had been arrested by the VDP.

**Contribution of the programme**: Amnesty Netherlands initiated 2 initial training sessions in monitoring, documentation and reporting (MDR) from 3 to 7 and 17 to 21 August 2020 respectively for 30 human rights monitors who are members of MBDHP and CIFDHA. 18 of the most assiduous and competent monitors received advanced training in SDR from 25 to 29 November 2020. All these monitors live in the centre-north, north and Sahel regions. A digital mechanism for reporting and documenting cases of abuse or violations has been developed thanks to funding from Amnesty and enables monitors to document the facts. Amnesty is supporting a supervisory team of 6 people to assess the quality and credibility of the cases reported by the monitors. All the cases will be processed and analysed in order to produce a report on the human rights situation in the areas concerned. Periodic case verification and coaching missions in the field for the monitors.
