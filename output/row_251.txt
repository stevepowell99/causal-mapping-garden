**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2312/PHR002
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On the 20th of April, 20 May and 29 December the Burundian prison authorities and the intelligence service (SNR) have released three missing persons and detainees, at the instigation of authorities at various levels. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The people abducted and detained by the SNR were released after a huge public outcry thanks to an ongoing social media campaign by AINL partner FOCODE.  The three cases demonstrate that the public and civil society can still influence the Burundian authorities if it concerns non-political cases.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: These are unjust imprisonments. The releases concern Corporal Jérôme Niyonkuru (on 29 December), Adrien Ndayizeye (on 20 April) and Haruna Mustafa (on 20 May). Corporal Jérôme Niyonkuru was imprisoned in Mpimba central prison simply for having publicly denounced the corruption that plagues the national police force in Burundi. His release was initiated by the President of the Republic, who claims to be against corruption, but only after a huge public outcry thanks to an ongoing campaign by our partner on social media.  Adrien NDAYIZEYE, an employee of the Burundi Revenue Office, was abducted on 05 January 2023 in Gitega, and released after three months of secret detention in the dungeon of the SNR (Service Nationale de Renseignement). Haruna Mustafa, a member of the Imbonerakure League, was abducted on 10 May 2023 from a hotel in Gitega, and released after 10 days of secret detention in the SNR's Gitega dungeon. These three cases show that the public and civil society can still influence the authorities in non-political cases.
**Rating significance**: early/small
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: Individual
**Contribution of the programme**: The contribution of the programme/partner is positive, intentional and great. FOCODE has repeatedly denounced the illegal detention of these people, through its communication channels on social networks and in the media, for example with the hashtag #FreeJeromeNiyonkuru with the photo of Corporal Jérôme Niyonkuru. FOCODE is known through its president for the effectiveness of its alerts. The FOCODE President's Facebook page, with 380,000 fans and 140,000 on Twitter, is widely followed by the country's senior authorities, partners and the general public. In the case of Corporal Jérôme Niyonkuru, FOCODE sent a message to the President of the Republic reminding him of his unjust imprisonment on 4 December 2023. The publication pointed out that Corporal Jérôme Niyonkuru had already been unjustly imprisoned for a total of 4 months, and called on the President of the Republic to take action, given that the same revelations made by Jérôme keep recurring in his speeches. The publication ended by reminding him that if nothing is done within the next 2 months, Corporal Jérôme will be permanently dismissed from the police force, which will be seen as a victory for those who influenced his imprisonment.  Adrien Ndayizeye and Haruna Mustafa were also released following FOCODE's warnings.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Other players who contributed to the releases were the media, which reported some cases, such as that of Corporal Jérôme. The public also played a major role in influencing these releases, through their comments on the various publications of FOCODE and its President.
