**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2312/PHR001
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On the 12th of April and the 15th of December 2023 the Burundian intelligence service (SNR) confirmed the whereabouts of three missing persons, much to the relief of their families and the public.
**Significance of the outcome**: People are often abducted by agents of the intelligence services or other people in power. Sometimes they are abducted from their homes or public places, as in the case of Janvier Ngendakuriyo and Pacifique Mahoro. Sometimes it is detainees who are exfiltrated from prison, often in the dead of night, to secret destinations, as in the case of Corporal Jean Ndikuriyo. In some cases, these individuals have never resurfaced, having been executed. In other cases, these prisoners are taken to the national intelligence service to be tortured or forced to sign documents under duress. So each reappearance in public prisons is a relief for the family and a victory for those campaigning against enforced disappearances.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Corporal Jean Ndikuriyo was returned to Mpimba prison on 15 December 2023. He had been taken out of prison on 26 November 2023 by Colonel Serges Nibigira, alias Gikona, the Prison Governor. Jean Ndikuriyo had been missing since 26 November. Serges Nibigira gave no explanation to the family of Corporal Ndikuriyo, leading the family to fear the worst for their loved one. On several occasions, when an abductee was found, he or she was in an SNR cell.  Janvier NGENDAKURIYO, a former employee of the National Assembly who spoke out on malpractices in the management of buildings, was abducted on 11 April 2023 at 6.30pm by men armed with pistols who broke into his residence in Gatunguru before taking him away in a Toyota Probox car. One day later, following a very rapid alert and a strong mobilisation on social networks, the SNR acknowledged that it was holding him. Pacifique MAHORO, an employee of BRARUDI and head of a civil society organisation, abducted en route in Ruziba on 10 April 2023. Two days later, following an alert from FOCODE, the SNR admitted that it was holding him.
**Rating significance**: early/small
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: Individual
**Contribution of the programme**: AINL partner FOCODE denounced these incidents and ensured diligent follow-up. On several occasions, the organisation used its communication channels on social networks and media platforms to inform the public and draw attention to the case. These persistent and strategic actions were aimed not only at keeping the issue on the public agenda, but also at exerting constant pressure on the authorities to hold them to account. By mobilising public opinion and placing the case in the media spotlight, FOCODE underlined the importance of transparency and justice, while striving to bring about significant change through these repeated commitments. When there is an early warning, authorities at various levels act directly or indirectly on the National Intelligence Service. Following the exfiltration of Corporal Jean Ndikuriyo, FOCODE issued alerts via its social networks and, after three weeks, he was returned to prison.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: The public has also been a major player, influencing change through their comments on the various denounciations by FOCODE and its President. Other media and digital platforms have also played a role in amplifying the alerts issued.
