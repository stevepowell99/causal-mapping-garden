**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In May 2025, Refugees International (RI) agreed to co-develop advocacy efforts with RPW on direct funding to refugee-led organizations, including planning a donor convening around the UN General Assembly (UNGA) to highlight the importance of supporting RLOs amid international aid cuts.
**Significance of the outcome**: RLOs have historically faced major obstacles in accessing direct funding, with donors typically channeling funds through INGOs and bypassing refugee-led actors. Despite ongoing advocacy, major donors and international organizations had shown limited willingness to change this dynamic. This outcome is critical for shifting entrenched funding power dynamics and advancing RPW’s strategic goal of empowering RLOs through equitable access to resources. It also addresses the urgency of funding gaps in light of broader aid cuts.
