**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**:  At its ordinary session held from May 11 to 27, 2023, in Banjul, Gambia, the Executive Council of the African Union adopted Resolution 636/16 – IHRDA and others against the Republic of Burundi. The decision recognizes the responsibility of the State of Burundi for human rights violations against 8 burundian victims living in exile in Rwanda and the Central African Republic. The decision was issued by the ACHPR during its 73rd Ordinary Session held from October 20 to November 9, 2022.
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to this decision, the State of Burundi had not acknowledged its responsibility for human rights violations committed against its citizens. This official recognition of Burundi’s involvement in human rights violations by the ACHPR paves the way for justice and reparations for victims, thus strengthening Burundi’s human rights protection and accountability, which is important for our program to promote justice and the protection of fundamental rights.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The eight victims in this case were victims of excessive repression linked to the crisis that began in April 2015, following the announcement of Pierre Nkurunziza's candidacy for a third term. Having been fortunate enough to flee the country alive, they went into exile. In 2016, our organisation submitted a communication to the ACHPR on their behalf to denounce the violations they faced. In its decision issued in November 2022, the ACHPR recognized the responsibility of the State of Burundi for the human rights violations committed and requested that the victims be compensated, but this decision has not yet been implemented. In November 2023, the victims received support for medical and psychological assessments, which will serve as a basis for assessing the harm suffered and calculating the compensation to be awarded to them.
