**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In October 2023, ten individuals in Telafar, who acquired disabilities due to the conflict with ISIS, founded a Community-Based Organization  with the mission of amplifying the voices of victims and advocating for their rights and justice. Two other individuals were employed by a CSO in Tel Aafar
**Significance of the outcome**: People with disabilities, particularly those who were affected by the war with ISIS, have seldom united and self-organized to advocate for their rights. They face compounded layers of exclusion and marginalization from society and are often unaware of their rights within the current transitional justice mechanism in Iraq. The creation of this platform is a significant step forward in reaching the obejctives of the project, as it demonstrates the project's ability to build the capacities of the most marginalized components of society and facilitate their representation in justice processes in mechanisms.
