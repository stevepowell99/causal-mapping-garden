**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**: In September 2024, UN Special Rapporteur on the right to food referenced PAX’s input on conflict impacts on food insecurity in Syria (among other places) in his report on “Starvation and the Right to Food, with an Emphasis on the Palestinian People’s Food Sovereignty”, which he presented to UN General Assembly in October 2024 
**Significance of the outcome**: Such acknowledgment helps to position the situation in Syria within the broader international discussion about conflict effects on food insecurity and about environmental impacts of conflicts more broadly. This is important for the issue not to fall out of the international attention, especially amid the decrease of international attention to Syria's needs after the acute conflict stage has ended.
