**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Kenya
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In February 2025 the Human Rights Council working group on the UPR acknowledged HURIA's and HSI's contribution of the UPR Joint submissions through the stakeholders summary report, dated 4th February 2025, and indicated as JS 21 and JS 22.
**Significance of the outcome**: The acknowledgment of HURIA’s and HSI's contribution in the Human Rights Council Working Group’s stakeholders’ summary report is highly significant as it validates our advocacy efforts at the international level. This recognition demonstrates that our submissions were not only timely and evidence-based but also influential enough to shape the discourse within the UPR process. Practically, this opens doors for deeper engagement with UN mechanisms, enhances the visibility of the human rights concerns raised and increases pressure on the Kenyan government to respond to those concerns.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The acknowledgment builds momentum for coalition-building with other CSOs, donor partners, and diplomatic missions, showing that grassroots-driven evidence can influence global accountability mechanisms. This outcome therefore not only reinforces our impact but also contributes to advancing systemic reforms and amplifying our work  in international human rights platforms. For instance, HURIA is currently engaging the UN Special Rapporteur on Protection of Human Rights while countering terrorism (Ben Saul)
