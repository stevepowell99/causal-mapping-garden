**FragmentID**: SCC-IRQ2312/GEQ1009
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On 11/11/2023, in the Nimrud district and upon community request, Azad Hassan, an actively engaged young representative of Sunni Arab victims of ISIS in the project, successfully completed the legal formalities to establish the first community-based organization in Nimrud, engaging more than 30 members. This organization subsequently joined Impunity Watch's Network of Victims of Enforced Disappearance.
**Significance of the outcome**: In the Nimrud district, the presence of civil society initiatives is scarce, despite the significant number of Sunni Arab victims of ISIS who lived under the control of the militant group. These victims have faced challenges in participating in justice dialogues and mechanisms due to their social marginalization, compounded by a lack of support and continued accusations directed at them solely for being Sunni Arabs. This issue is prevalent across disputed territories formerly under ISIS control, as Sunni Arabs as a group are excluded from the benefits of the national survivors' law. The establishment of the Community-Based Organization (CBO) represents a significant advancement in ensuring Sunni Muslim victims receive the same rights and recognition as other victims.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: Azad is a young Sunni Muslim man whose hand was horribly amputated because of an unfair ruling by the militant group. He told his story in the first Ninewa victims forum organized by PFO and grantees in August 2022. 
**Rating significance**: medium
**Social actor**: Engaged citizens
**Scale**: Local
**Contribution of the programme**: Since becoming active in the project in August 2022, Azad took part of most capacity-building and coaching efforts organized by the alliance partners and PFO. Despite initially having no civil society experience, Azad gradually became a leading and influential figure in the project. On August 12 2023 (International Youth day), PFO organized the second annual Ninewa Victims Forum  in Mosul. One of the main functions of forum is to conduct targeted community consultations and collect input to inform the planning of the project. Azad facilitated a dialogue table with victims and survivors from Nimrud, where participants flagged the lack of civil society activity in the area and the need for more formal representation for sunni arab victims. Supported by PFO and PAX, and thanks to the technical and financial skills he acquired through the project, Azad established the first CBO himself, focusing on the most pressing needs highlighted through the discussions.
