**FragmentID**: SCC-SSU2305/ESF043
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: South Sudan
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In December 2022, the Director General of the National Security Services of South Sudan invited an Human Rights Defenders monitor to his office in Juba to discuss the reports on Human Rights Violations by Natonal Security Service officers. It is an important development since this is the first time that the Director General of the National Security Service engages with members of civil society. As a result of the shrinking civil space in South Sudan this was a great risk for the organisation to meet with the National Security Service.
**Significance of the outcome**: The meeting is a first of its kind from  the Dirctor General since it shows progressive steps towards opening up discussions on human rights and civic space related issues. National Security Service has previously been a feared institution with limited engagement with the civic society/Human Right Defenders unless they are arresting you. National Security Service officials behaviour has been a major stambling block to enjoyment of civil liberty by the Human Rights Defenders and civil society members. The Director General asked the Human Rights Defenders not to work to tarnish his image with damning reports. This activity contributes to Special Objective 1, referring to the wish for engagement between Human Rights Defenders and the leadership of National Security Service on human right violations within NSS.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The Human Right Defenders invited hails from the same community with the Director General, the community lineage could have played a role to the invitation. Additionally, prior to sit downs with the Director General, the monitor was guided by the South Sudan Human Right Defenders Network secretariate on how to effectively advocate to reduce civic space violations.
