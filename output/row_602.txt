**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Iraq
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In early 2025, the ministry of education in Iraq and parliament member (the committee of education) took concrete steps to facilitate the right of education, such as opening new exam centers in Rabea and Gayyara, removing age conditions, and awarding grants for young women from Nimrud (including a young woman with disability) to complete their university studies.
**Significance of the outcome**: Age has become a barrier preventing young women in rural areas from completing their education. Due to displacement and the long-term impacts of conflict, many have exceeded the age limit for public education. Now, they are required to pay to attend distant educational centers, while evening university programs remain too expensive. As a result, many feel excluded from their right to reparation and access to education
