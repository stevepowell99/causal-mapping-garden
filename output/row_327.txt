**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Yemen
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: In 2023, by expanding its network of monitors, Mwatana gained access to document violations in remote areas around Yemen, such as the remote districts of Hadramout, and increased its reporting capacity with 40% in comparison to previous years according to the Research Unit.  
**Significance of the outcome**: Expanding access to remote areas and effectively documenting and reporting human rights violations can assist national and international stakeholders in obtaining an accurate understanding of the human rights situation in Yemen. This is important even in areas that appear to be calm and far from the conflict between parties. The number of Mwatana's reports in 2022 was XX, as a result of this expansion in 2023 the number of reports increaded to XX.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In 2023, one trainee who has participated  in the capacity-building workshops, started reporting XX human rights violation incidents to Mwatana, where he got access to remote districts of Hadramout and documented forgotten violations in these remote areas.
