**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2305/CIV011
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In August 2022, a number of Burundian Survivors of CRSV including (W)HRDs in exile in Uganda were selected by ICC as potential witnesses for the proceedings on the investigations into crime against humanity committed in Burundi between 2015 and 2017. This followed the launch of a report on CRSV and the various engagements with the ICC team and Light for All representative. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Since 2017,  the ICC has been gathering evidence to support its process of carrying out investigations into crimes against humanity committed in Burundi. The ICC visits to survivors of CRSV was a step in providing more evidence and securing potential witnesses for its process of extending justice to survivors. Without meeting the survivors there would be limited evidence and grounds for ICC proceedings. The identification of witnesses is important in ensuring that the perpetrators of crimes against humanity are brought to book and justice for the victims is realised. 
**Additional information (use if needed) **: When the research was launched, ICC was one of the stakeholders that received the report and picked an interest in meeting the  survivors. ICC staff organized and met with different suvivors who provided more evidence on crimes against humanity including sexual violence. Some of the survivors were selected as potential witnesses.
