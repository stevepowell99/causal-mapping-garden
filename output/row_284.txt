**Outcome description**: In 2023, HSI has documented 05 cases of enforced disappearance in which the victim was released after a short period, which suggests a new trend in how perpetrators have been conducting abductions in Lamu and Garissa.
**Significance of the outcome**: Quite significant as it is unique to have interviewed surviors of ED and get details on how they were handled while in custody, though due to fear of reprisals they may not pursue any form of justice. Another important aspect relates to the fact that these incidents suggest the change in tactics in counter-terror operations by agents of the State.
