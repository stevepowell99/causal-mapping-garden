**FragmentID**:  SCC-SUD2312/PHR004
**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 2
**coutnry**: Sudan
**Year**: 2023
**Outcome description**: On the 12th of October 2023, the Rapid Support Forces (RSF) one of the 2 state military actors fighting in Sudan, released Mohamed a human rights defender based in Khartoum who had vanished without a trace in on 29 May, 2023. This happened after the RSF was pressured by the office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights in Geneva. 
**Significance of the outcome**: The war in Sudan has led to a massive rise in the number of ED cases. RSF and SAF are all guilty parties of this act, and to see one of these military actors succumbing to the pressure of the UN Committee on ED is significant for the SCC programme in Sudan. Besides the documentation and monitoring work done by PAX partners around ED, we are also working on L&A on this theme with ACJPS and AoM.  Therefore this is a key L&A outcome that came as a result of direct pressure exerted by ACJPS who had presentations and key meetings with the UNCED in Geneva.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: The war between RSF and RSF has been characterized by several human rights violations including arbitrary arrest, incommunicado detention and enforced disappearance often perpetuated by both the Sudanese Armed Forces (SAF) and the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces (RSF). The number of “missing” people have been increasing since the war erupted in April 2023. The Missing Initiative, a local online initiative and PAX partner dedicated to helping find people who are unaccounted documented over 229 cases of missing persons, 15 of which were women and girls by 16 June 2023.  On 12 September 2023, the Office of the High Commissioner for Human Rights  corroborated this distressing trend, revealing that at least 500 people have been reported as disappeared since the start of the war. By October 2023, ACJPS had registered at least 700 cases of enforced disappearance in its newly established enforced disappearance database.

**Contribution of the programme**: On 11 September 2023, ACJPS attended the 25th session of the UN Committee on Enforced Disappearance in Geneva Switzerland. The delegation had the opportunity during the opening session to present testimony of a family member of a victim of enforced disappearance in Sudan and explained to the Committee the alarming increase in enforced disappearance cases since the war erupted on 15th April 2023. The Committee responded to testimony by expressing empathy and promised to do what they could to follow up on the matter. However, they also advised the delegation to present the testimony and other enforced disappearance complaints in the form of urgent appeals so that they could engage the Sudanese authorities for the release of the victims.  On the same day, the delegation held a private meeting with the Committee where they highlighted the increasing trend of enforced disappearances of human rights defenders and activists for their advocacy efforts against the ongoing armed conflict. The delegation explained the trend, pattern, and main victims of enforced disappearance.  At the end of the meeting, the committee guided the delegation on different ways that they could engage the committee in advocating for the release of victims and advocating for ending the practice. Additionally, the Office of the UN High Commissioner on Human Rights in Geneva held interviews with ACJPS delegates on the testimony and later published it on their website and social media accounts and called for the victim's release
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: ACJPS mentioned that they never got formal feedback on whether the committee intervened in his release, because this will be too sensitive for the UN to share. However, they believe there was action taken from Geneva and also other social media campaigns in Sudan on this case contributed. This includes efforts of the local OHCHR office in Sudan and PAX-supported youth activists from the Alliance of the Missing. ACJPS has also submitted at least three other cases to the Committee.
