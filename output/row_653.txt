**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Sahel/Mali
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: In April 2025, during their advocacy mission in Dakar, TRIJEUD and ADD (Mali) submitted the latest MDR report to the United Nations Independent Expert on the situation of human rights in Mali and to the AI Regional Office.
**Significance of the outcome**: Before April 2025, organisations were unable to disseminate MDR reports to regional or international bodies due to restrictions on civic space preventing organisations from bringing this information to national and regional levels. This development is important because it enables Malian civil society to document and bring human rights violations beyond the national level, thereby increasing the visibility of Malian issues and international pressure in favour of human rights.
