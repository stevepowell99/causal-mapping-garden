**FragmentID**: SCC-BUR2508/PHR008
**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2025
**Outcome description**: On January 1, 2025, the Deputy Attorney General of Makamba released Adonette Manirakiza after 11 days of arbitrary detention, following an alert from FOCODE. Three days later, Minani Elias, alias Agripeche, the businessman who initiated her incarceration, was prosecuted for rape and sexual harassment—a rare occurrence for a locally influential figure.
**Significance of the outcome**: The significance of this case is particularly noteworthy, as it remains exceptional for a CNDD-FDD member, who is also an influential businessman at the provincial level, to be arrested and prosecuted for an offense involving a private citizen. Before Adonette's imprisonment, judicial and administrative authorities were widely perceived to be involved in corrupt practices and influence peddling. This case, although isolated, marks a break in a system long characterized by elite impunity.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: FOCODE significantly contributed to achieving the program’s objectives by mobilizing its communication channels to denounce the arbitrary arrest of Adonette Manirakiza. Between December 31, 2024, and January 14, 2025, a series of alerts were published on the Facebook page of the FOCODE president (450,000 followers), on his official Facebook page (25,000 followers), and on his X page (15,000 followers). This strong mobilization on social media generated considerable public pressure, forcing the judicial authorities to reconsider their position. It resulted in the release of Adonette and the opening of proceedings against the businessman Agripeche, thus directly contributing to the program’s efforts to promote justice  and finght against impunity.
