**Outcome status**: Outcome lead
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 1
**coutnry**: Lebanon
**Year**: 2022
**Outcome description**: In June 2022, in a meeting with Gillian Triggs, the Assistant High Commissioner for Protection in Geneva, she reaffirmed that UNHCR does not have the intention to change their fundraising policies to start funding refugee-led organization and patronized the work of refugee-led organizations. 
**Significance of the outcome**: Gillan Triggs explict statements verifies RLOs' speculation that UNHCR is not willing to change its funding policies. Therefore, RPW will need to continue urging donors to explicitly commit to accelerate aid localisation efforts and commitments, by pledging more resources to humanitarian, development, human rights, and peacebuilding projects and programmes by local civil society organisations and Refugee-Led Organisations (RLOs). As part of such localisation efforts, provide financial support to RLO initiatives, such as the Resourcing Refugees Leadership Initiative (RRLI) and its RLO-to-RLO fund.
