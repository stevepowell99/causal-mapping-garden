**Outcome status**: Outcome
**OH-harvesting period**: harvest 3
**coutnry**: Burundi
**Year**: 2024
**Outcome description**:  On 15th February 2024,  the Executive Council of the African Union, sitting at its 44th session in Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, adopted the resolution on Communication 587/15 – Radio Publique Africaine v. Burundi, issued by the ACHPR.
**Significance of the outcome**: Prior to this decision, the Burundian state was implicated in numerous human rights violations, while systematically denying any responsibility in this regard. The decision marks a significant change as the Commission formally acknowledges human rights violations (Articles 1, 9, 12(1), 13(1) of the African Charter) by the Burundian state and urges it to take concrete measures to protect journalists and ensure their access to justice. This directly supports the program’s objectives of strengthening freedom of expression, the safety of journalists, and state accountability for violations.
**Additional information (use if needed) **: In May 2015, during the failed coup against President Pierre Nkurunziza, the headquarters of several independent media outlets, such as RPA, Isanganiro, Bonesha FM, and Radio-Télé Renaissance, were attacked and burned by the police and army, before being closed. Subsequently, the government intensified its crackdown on journalists, particularly those critical of the government. Several received death threats, were arrested, intimidated, or placed under surveillance, forcing many into exile. That same year, the CB-CPI submitted a communication to the ACHPR against the State of Burundi, accusing it of violating the provisions of the African Charter on Human and Peoples' Rights. The decision, issued during the ordinary session held from February 21 to March 7, 2023, was not made public until April 24, 2025, two years later.
**Rating significance**: large
**Social actor**: State authorities
**Scale**: International 
**Contribution of the programme**: The CB CPI contributed to the change in that on 10 November 2015, it submitted the Communication to the ACHPR and followed up on the case. There were also follow up actions to unblock the drafting of the decision and ultimately a decision recognizing the violations committed against the RPA was obtained, thus laying the foundations for a demand for justice and enhanced protection for journalists.
**Contribution of other actors and factors**: Yes. A commissioner from the ACHPR played a key role in unblocking the process of drafting the decision.  The notification of its adoption had been communicated to us as early as 2023, but without the full text being available.
