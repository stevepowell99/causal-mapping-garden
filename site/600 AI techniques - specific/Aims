We want to increase explicit human participation in the construction of the coding method and decrease implicit human participation in the execution of the method

We want to:

- maximise the proportion of respondent information available which is actually included in a top-line report like a map with the most frequent 5 factors
- ensure that the quote associated with any link between two factors can indeed be validly understood as making that causal claim
- maximise the utility of the map by using labels which are concrete, memorable, not generic and where appropriate, surprising
